# EmoConsistency-PoliticalPolarization
## Problem Statement
We want to figure out whether the current political polarization is associated with the emotional values expressed by each party. Due to the current politically charged environment of our country, the semblance of sympathizing toward a value that is not related to your political party causes backlash. This fear of backlash can create a “false” polarized environment, which is an extension of the fear itself. The question that arises is whether these boundaries are reinforced by the people themselves and/or  external factors, like social media.

## Research Question
1. Do political parties exhibit similar emotional responses to differing ideologies?

## Methodology
To investigate this topic, we will analyze content from the top five YouTube channels associated with Democratic and Republican viewpoints, based on subscriber counts. The channels selected for the study are:

- **Democratic-leaning Channels**: Vice, Vox, MSNBC, The Daily Show, The Young Turks
- **Republican-leaning Channels**: Fox News, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, The Daily Mail, The Daily Wire

We have identified eight key ideologies for this analysis to understand if there are emotional differences in how political parties discuss these topics. For each ideology, a set of keywords has been established to facilitate data scraping:

- **ISIS**: Terrorism, Extremism, Radical
- **Guns**: Shootings, School shooting, Firearms, Gun control, NRA, Second Amendment
- **Immigration**: Border control, Mexico, Visa /Citizenship, Asylum, Deportation, Refugee
- **Economy**: Budget deficit, Unemployment, Inflation, Interest rate, Federal Reserve, Market, Employment
- **Health care**: Medicaid, Covid, Obamacare, Public health, Insurance
- **Socio-economic**: Rich / poor, Income inequality, Poverty, Wealth distribution
- **Abortion**: Pregnancy, Unwanted Pregnancy, Roe, Wade, Abortion, Pro-life, Rape, Incest, Life of mother, Religion
- **Climate change**: Global Warming, Carbo, Alternative Energy, Climate, Methane, Emissions, Gas, Greenhouse
