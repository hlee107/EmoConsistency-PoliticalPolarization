# EmoConsistency-PoliticalPolarization
## Problem Statement
We want to figure out whether the current political polarization is associated with the emotional values expressed by each party. Due to the current politically charged environment of our country, the semblance of sympathizing toward a value that is not related to your political party causes backlash. This fear of backlash can create a “false” polarized environment, which is an extension of the fear itself. The question that arises is whether these boundaries are reinforced by the people themselves and/or  external factors, like social media.

## Methodology

- Left: Vice, Vox, MSNBC, The Daily Show, The Young Turks
- Right: Fox News, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, The Daily Mail, The Daily Wire
