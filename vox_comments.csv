If you come to America for any reason and want to become a legal citizen, the “right” way or whatever you want to call it, we’re going to make it extremely difficult for you. If you want to leave, you won’t be able to come back. The natural reaction is to stay illegally, and their family from the country they came from are probably going to just sneak in as well so they won’t have to be separated. 

The fact that there’s so many undocumented immigrants then and now just proves that there’s a huge desire to come here, which is something Americans literally brag about, and that people will find a way in. Making it harder to be a legal citizen means they will simply continue to do things illegally.

Have a US citizen brother? Congratulations! Have him sponsor you and you'll have your visa in 15-20 years (Check Visa Bulletin. For Mexicans F4 they are processing applications filed April 22nd 1999). 

Employment based sponsorship is extremely difficult and if you were born in India or China then you have no path to permanent residence.

An hour of labor in Mexico costs much less than an hour of labor in the US. But a commodity made in Mexico is worth the same as a commodity made in the US. Value is extracted by producing in low labor price countries and bringing the products to high labor priced countries. That only works if goods can flow freely, but not labor. 

States are also only obligated to uphold the rights of citizens (and many states don't). The US frequently does horrific things to non-citizens. The state system is perhaps the leading cause of global poverty and wealth inequality.

Kids are definitely expensive and it's not causation but more correlation.

Several Mediterranean countries face serious housing crises, low(er) wages and few job opportunities: countries such as Greece and Spain have on average an unemployment rate of 11%. Children take space, children cost money. So if you cannot afford to have children and are stuck living at your parents, you simply postpone or not take children at all.
I'm pretty sure that in the coming decades this is something you're going to see more in northern European countries as well. Because for example here in the Netherlands, even though wages increase the costs of living keep on increasing, there's a serious housing crisis and studying could mean building up a debt that can go up or past the € 50,000.-. And then there are the problems to come, with a system that favours the boomers while there's a shitload of crises such as the climate that are going to cost a huge amount of money.

It's a very small sum for parents who take care of their kid at home and it's only until the kid is 3yo. But daycare centres are extremely cheap and free for families with small income. Preschool is mandatory and free. Public school is free and there aren't many private schools.
Monetarily suported mother's leave is 10 months but after that you can take a separate parental leave that you get a small amount of money as support.

This isn't sensationalizing or overstating what vaccines/boosters do. However, color me a cynical skeptic, but the fact that Dr. Gounder's a member of the COVID-19 Advisory Panel leads me to wonder how much of a role the pharmaceuticals play in her suggestions. And I'm not even suggesting something underhanded; the simple fact that Big Pharma is certainly in close contact (no pun intended) with the Panel increases the probability that they have influence or sway, whether intentional or not. For instance, Dr. Gounder could have very easily made the case that Omicron is a more contagious but less severe variant, suggesting that we are headed towards a mild endemic disease.

This would be a good point in the video to cover the US estate tax. It's... technically applied to the amount inherited, which is not taxed as capital gains. But it's only applied at all to individuals with estates worth over $5.3 Million, or couples worth twice that much, and only to amounts beyond that amount.
Naturally, one of our political parties has been working hard to make the estate tax apply to fewer and fewer people, with the goal of eventually eliminating it.
The estate tax is the small note worth mentioning for this portion of the video. But it really needs to be emphasized that the federal estate tax only applies to about 0.1% of estates in the US, leaving this video accurate on capital gains remaining untaxed in an estate an overwhelming portion of the time (not 99.9%, since there's often nothing to inherit here.)",2022-02-21T13:25:55Z,6
