They include Justice Samuel Alito, who in 2021 delivered a lecture bemoaning the “hostility to religion or at least the traditional religious beliefs that are contrary to the new moral code that is ascendant in some sectors,” and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who told Notre Dame law graduates that their legal careers are “but a means to an end” of “building the kingdom of God.”

Johnson’s theory, summed up, appears to be what might be dubbed, “the First Amendment for me but not for thee.” As he has described it in his own words, “the founders wanted to protect the church from the encroaching state, not the other way around.” But only when that church is Christian.

Mike Johnson might have been an obscure, four-term congress member but he will soon be well-known by every American — as the architect of Jan6 an election denier, an anti-abortion extremist and a slasher of Social Security and Medicare. --  POLITICO",2024-02-21T04:58:43Z,6

Without a doubt I’m an immigrant so I def know one of the hardest workers are immigrants and less trouble ones . However there a diff between coming here legally and illegally . At some point where is the line ? Yes you do sympathize for them but if we do one we have to do the entire world and that not going to happen . One of the thing no one ever talk about is what can one person cost how bad can it be ? Just set your foot to the hospital and imagine all the doctors n specialists are not being paid for the massive hours they put in for peoples who insurance dont cover . Than we have peoples that know not to work over certain amount so they can be on assistance or so many ways on n on .

More immigrant workers doesn't mean less stuff for others, it means more stuff for everyone. Workers don't just add to consumption, although when they do they are contributing to growth; they also add to production, and they are very productive as a rule. That means more profits for business and more tax money collected.

It should be obvious that more population doesn't equate to economic loss, or larger countries would always be poorer than smaller countries. They're not.

So, a focus of a conservative administration must be an investment in those things, as well as the protection of civil political and property rights.

4 In his pride the wicked man does not seek him;
in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
5 His ways are always prosperous;
your laws are rejected by[a] him;
he sneers at all his enemies.

However this discussion  ignored two significant   matters. Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade are educated & accomplished attorneys. They are both involved in a historic precedent setting case. It doesn't  matter to me what they did behind closed doors as long as it was consensual. However, being very smart practicing attorneys involved in such an historic case, why on earth didn't Ms. Willis foresee the potential  problems and avoid the appearance of alleged impropriety of financial gain  by paying back Mr. Wade by Cash App or PayPal or asking Mr. Wade to provide her  with a receipt upon paying him in cash?
The second issue I didn't  hear addressed is the tax lien owed by MS. Willis for under $5000.00 that was brought up in court & not disputed. 
I've had 2 such liens and know the interest accrues rapidly in addition to late fees AND substantial fee then owed to tax collection agencies which is very steep. Why would she keep cash and not pay a tax lien that keeps accruing?
  Those two issues are far more troublesome to me. Again, these are two highly educated  & accomplished  professionals. Their financial choices make no sense to me.

To claim the use of campaign funds for personal trips is a clear violation of the law, as any surplus funds from a campaign should not be allocated for personal use. These actions demonstrate a disregard for the established legal framework, which the district attorney is well aware of. Furthermore, the assertion that this was done with a sense of authority is nothing short of a joke. Additionally, evidence has emerged indicating a conflict of interest in the relationship, particularly in 2019. It is evident that the district attorney's credibility is compromised, as she consistently resorts to rambling and vague statements, often prefaced by the phrase ""let me be very clear.""
