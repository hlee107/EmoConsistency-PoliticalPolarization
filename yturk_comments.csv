I had never gone to school with any student that was not white. My first black classmates were in 8th grade. I was privy to seeing a klan meeting 4th of July prior to the integration (spying on them from a hill with other kids) and seeing our Sheriff and many of my parents friends from business and church. The hatred that was spewed and fomented was frightening. I am feeling the same fear today as I listen to the rhetoric of the Republican party and the cult that surrounds it. I will be 69 in March and I am sickened by the reversal of so much of the hard work of all those for civil rights.

We as Americans need to flip the script on the solution to our Social Security, and our social security as a population, that our continued procreation numbers dropping is detrimental for the country. Thusly, to avert our Social Security accounts, and our social security population numbers, we need to invite immigrants to the country. We need to accept all these good people and let them live and work in this country. Television has beamed the American culture into every home everywhere with a television. People from other countries are already conditioned to be accepting of American culture and lifestyles.

More immigrant workers doesn't mean less stuff for others, it means more stuff for everyone. Workers don't just add to consumption, although when they do they are contributing to growth; they also add to production, and they are very productive as a rule. That means more profits for business and more tax money collected.

It should be obvious that more population doesn't equate to economic loss, or larger countries would always be poorer than smaller countries. They're not. There is only one reason Americans are so ignorant about economics, and that is because nobody is explaining it to them, and Republicans are lying to them.

The relentless partisan clashes have drowned out the values that once earned my loyalty. It's no light decision, but a deliberate shift toward a more harmonious political landscape.

The relentless dissonance and cacophony of conflicting voices have nudged me to seek a new political melody. Though I've treasured Democratic ideals, the current discord demands a moment of introspection.

So, with a farewell blending nostalgia and optimism, I step into uncharted political waters. It's not a rejection of principles but a genuine quest for a political symphony in tune with my beliefs. Remarkably, this journey leads me to cast my vote for Donald Trump in 2024‚Äîa surprising twist fueled by a longing for a more constructive and respectful political discourse.",2024-01-28T19:43:47Z,0

Journalists should have been on this a long time ago. Texas saw a 10% drop in medical graduates heading there in 2022, that number could have only grown in 2023, and you know it's even worse in 2024. Even a 10% drop is not sustainable, because you need new starters just to maintain adequate levels of care to cover retirees, that doesn't even factor in a growing population or changes in medical needs due to spikes in seasonal illness. Couple that with the loss of staff leaving for work in a better state where they aren't threatened with imprisonment just for doing their jobs, and the loss of training staff able to teach new arrivals, and you have exponential growth of decline in services.

The same is going to happen to teaching, because hundreds of thousands of teachers want to escape the culture war bs the Republicans are inflicting on them.
The people who support these failed policies seem to be unable to work out the inevitable consequences of their own stupidity. They seem to think it will only impact the people they want to target with these policies. But just as we're seeing in Florida with the loss of migrant workers leading to businesses failing, it's all going to have a knock-on impact on tax revenues, education standards, general medical care and so much more.

Another good example is Republican states attacking colleges. Students bring money into the community, they work part-time jobs for low pay in bars and restaurants, when your policies threaten those students and they decide to go and study elsewhere you not only see a decline in the student population, you see a decline in tax revenues, loss of business and staff for bars and restaurants, all the supporting industries start to decline.

Just ask Detroit what happened due to losing a couple of car plants - and they weren't even integral to public services. That economic collapse happened not just because the plants closed, but because all of the supporting businesses lost their workers, people moved out, stores had to close leading to more unemployment, tax revenues collapsed leading to less investment, leading to more people leaving, leading to more businesses closing, leading to more unemployment.

When you vote for politicians who put ideology above common sense and mathematical reality, this is what you get.",2024-02-19T19:21:01Z,29
