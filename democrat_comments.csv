It's always hard to find treatment, housing, food, work for them. But this year has been a nightmare. Even the homeless shelters are turning people away. Rehabs are closed to new patients, most places aren't hiring (especially places that employ felons), offices where you get your ID and apply for SSDI are online-only which doesn't help people who don't have a phone. This year has sucked for everyone, and a lot of people have lost their jobs and are scared of what the future will bring. But if you have a safe place to sleep every night, if you have food in your fridge, be grateful. Many people are one bad car accident away from losing their livelihood and their home.

I was homeless for 10 years roughly from 1969. At that time there was no support at all. Police kept moving us on so we never got a night's sleep. No shelters and the only food was from the very sparse (only one soup kitchen I knew of)  Salvation Army who expected you to stand and sing hymns with them for about an hour before giving you a bowl of soup. I worked whenever I could but it was difficult without any adequate sleep. Most nights in the winter months I laid down of a night not expecting to wake up again. Most people despised us and attacked us frequently. Thanks largely to a few good people I survived and turned my luck around. Most rough sleepers I met had some sort of mental problem but were scared to seek help because it could mean a lifetime in a mental institution if you were certified. This guy is going through some difficulties for sure but he doesn't know how lucky he is to be living in this time when so much is available for the homeless. There still needs to be more of course and there needs to be more attention paid to the causes of homelessness.,2020-06-24T03:08:13Z,1

My wounds that are slowly healing is keeping myself from working to pay the 525.00 a month need fee. This is really, really bad timing for all of this !!! Again, Thank You for sharing this video with us all.  If anyone might be from my area and know of any agencies or other organizations that would be able, willing to help me I'd greatly appreciate the info. JUST comment on this and I'll see what info is there. Thank You.. God Bless You All  !!!! Rudy Duran...ü§îü§î",2020-08-17T00:32:27Z,0

-Falsely portraying Tate by cutting clips of his reactions from one question to others (proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Colks-OJ71M)
- They vocally supported AH during that whole trial
- Recently put out an ""expose"" on the Japanese anime industry painting it as a haven for predators while locking access to the video in Japan for their people to refute those claims, which aren't true btw
- Sydney Watson who was recently on a lopsided feminist discussion panel, which was just a failed trojan horse to slander non feminist women, got copyright claimed by vice for posting a video about her reaction to being on that panel even though she was INVITED BY VICE
- The woman in the current video has already been confirmed as a liar years ago about this very case, but yet they still interview her and post a perfectly timed video bashing Tate while he's already in custody so cannot even defend himself

If you resisted, you were  either fired, killed. Traffic cops wouldn't even give tickets, they would right away ask for money.

I am somewhere between a follower of Ned Ludd and a follower of Jean Luc Picard. I am excited for many of these (possible) changes to the world that can extend the shelf life of humans--and I'm okay with a lot more of the alternatives and makeshift visions in this video than almost anyone I grew up with--but I also think that most of the folks in the Pacific Northwest of the United States who are dragging behind these alternatives and visions are worried about the disconnect between our physical selves' involvement with this physical world. 

I love working on cars. I love it. It's one of the most white trash markers of my identity that I fully embrace, even though I've been a labor, political, and community organizer in order to eat for most of the past fifteen years. 

These transitions, for what may or may not be a ""rare bird"" like myself, must include how we can remain physical bodies engaged with and connected to our physical world. I like that connection. I like trees--planting them, trimming them, cutting them down when need be. I like mechanical stuff and the fact that the old cars that don't require the latest version of MS Office are accessible to me to Lego and tinker with. I like CDs and Albums. 

In short: I am a sucker for the sensate world. 

I have tried to imagine how to transition Oregon's economically depressed coastal towns that used to be timber towns into paying positions that are more vital and productive but still allow the dirt to get under your fingernails. I imagine someone whose  parent logged trees because s/he loved the smell and feel of the forest being able to have a job in the same place, with the same solitude in nature essential to a healthy ego that knows it ain't the Alpha or Omega because it's able to see its own smallness out there and have nature fill the nostrils--maybe the one who is planting a bio-diverse future of trees is simultaneously living the tradition of their ancestor while doing the needed and productive thing out there today (planting rather than reaping what nature has sewn.)

We often got requests from agencies to field Students (who pay those  agencies to have the experience) to spend 3 months summer volunteering work. What these agencies do not realize is that Training volunteers to do the required work is a challenge due to many factors - language barriers, skills fitness, commitment, safety considerations, discipline, etc. More often nonprofits need to allocate a full time staff paid to manage these volunteers, an expensive resource to an already financially vulnerable organization. By the time those kids finally got the hang of things, it‚Äôs time for them to leave. There were also occasions where the students skills were not at a level they said they have on their CVs. We‚Äôve decided to turn down those volunteer requests except if they are for longer period like one year, because otherwise it‚Äôs highly disruptive on the operations and resources and it does not give more meaningful benefit and impact to both the students and the organization.",2023-06-29T23:33:40Z,12

Cos the state in India where I'm from, Kerala - witnessed something like this, but more sinister. In 1984 (before I was even born), there was a man called Sukumara Kurup who also wanted to encash on a hefty insurance policy he'd bought. He and his accomplices first kidnapped and murdered an innocent man who shared physical resemblance (height and weight) with him and engineered a road traffic accident in the dead of the night. They seated the victim in the driver's seat, deliberately crashed the car (the accused's own) and intentionally set it alight, completely charring the car and its occupant.
He disappeared but the plan didn't actually work - thankfully. The police soon came to the conclusion that the body belonged to another man whose wife had reported him as missing for 2 days. She identified him from the remnants of his burned underwear - the only thing they were able to retrieve from the crime scene. Remember this was an age when modern DNA testing methods were still in their infancy. 
Their suspicion rose further when they paid a visit to the accused's house. The relatives didn't look to be particularly distressed and they were even witnessed to be eating chicken - this NEVER happens in a grieving Indian household. 
The clinching evidence came when one of the main accused's accomplices and neighbor came to the police station for questioning. He was wearing a neatly pressed full sleeve shirt - again something of an anomaly. Upon interrogation, they found he was wearing it to conceal the burn wounds he'd sustained on his forearms whilst setting the car alight. And then, the house of lies they built quickly collapsed like a pack of cards.
P. S - The crime was solved but they never captured Mr Kurup, the criminal who faked his own death. He's been on the run ever since. They were close to catching him multiple times; so much so that once they broke into his hotel room to notice the tea in the cup was still warm - a la Pablo Escobar. 
If he's alive today, he'd be around 80 years old. A fugitive on a never ending run; a lifetime in hiding - perhaps a greater punishment than anything else?",2023-05-28T11:56:05Z,560

Going back to a trading system, where in order to acquire the good you need (food,medicine, etc) you need to have the good that the other person wants, in order to have successful trade, aka. commerce.   Gone will be the days of going 1 place and being able to get everything you need in a short time, and then use standard recognized currency to get everything you need.  Instead you will seek out each vendor, and then need to find things they may need in order to acquire the goods you need.  I know this is very simple, but it seems lately to have escaped the thought processes of the future enlightened.  There is much to consider in life, but not every idea is a good one.  You must have wisdom to think ahead and see the path you are on, which normally only comes with age, or intense study from childhood.  Going backwards to a trading system, is regressive, and will only cause hardship for everyone.",2020-09-07T20:48:09Z,4

Making abortions illegals doesn't stop abortions: it stops SAFE abortions. What is important is finding out the causes of these abortions and why the child is not being kept rather than effectively torturing the mother and the potentially-still-being-aborted child for no other reason other than to say ""we followed our faith and beliefs!"" 


Now, I have two things to ask those people:
1) If you are doing this for God, then why does it matter if other people think you are following your beliefs or not as long as God knows? If I want to try to stop abortions, then I am going to be a kind and open individual who is trying to convince and help people to keep the child. Sure, on paper you see that I am technically pro-choose, pro-Planned Parenthood, etc etc, but I don't care about that. What I care about is that I am personally helping a potential mother by improving her life in a way that can convince her to keep the child, and to potentially convince her of my beliefs without forcing my beliefs onto her.
2) Knowing all of this, why are you intentionally trying to make women suffer? If we understand that making abortions illegal only stops safe abortions, and you are okay with that because ""these women deserve to suffer and die for this murder they felt this dire, life-altering need to commit,"" then you are not a damn Christian! No Christian should want to ENCOURAGE the PAIN AND SUFFERING of ANYONE. We must forgive and understand. We must learn from our pasts, our presents, and use that to try to change our futures. 


And for those who will now try to pull the Westboro Baptist Church card on me, I have this conspiracy theory that they are actually Satanists trying to drive people away from God, because - let's be real - that is exactly what they are doing.",2019-06-01T05:08:52Z,25

After spending countless hours of conversation with detox nurses (almost always non ex addicts), who often pick my brain for a better understanding themselves, I've come to the conclusion that
 1. There's a desperate need for ex-addicts to transition into professional positions leading the charge towards effective treatment because 2. 'Treatment' is often just a business opportunity for people who take advantage of the stigma and misunderstandings of drug addiction. 3. The stigmas around addiction, responsible for the lack of progress and isolation of addicts, needs to change ( and it is, wait till it's your loved one) 4. Places depicted in the film are only really necessary because ^all of the above has lead to a great need for harm reduction. My best friend, from childhood, passed last year from an infection and I wish he was never so isolated, heartbroken from the misconceptions and recklessly using when 5. *Community is pretty much the meaning of life for humans. With community an addict has the reason, the capacity and support to say ""I can do this, I owe it to myself and everyone who loves me and I believe in myself""* 

I hope something shifts in the way we approach addiction, as a whole. This will effect you too, if it hasn't somehow already and nobody's immune.

When you have true passion for something you forget everything, you block out everything else. I for example am afraid of getting drowned, I have phobia to deep water. I don't know how to swim and I had been paralyzed by fear even in public pools BUT I once decided I wanted to do underwater photos in a cenote. I hired a pro diver, learned the basics of diving with oxygen in a couple minutes and went deep into a very deep cenote. I focused entirely in the pictures. I even pushed myself harder and deeper to get better shots. Death wasn't an issue, fear was just something useless for me to take the pictures, an annoying obstacle that I pushed aside with hatred or disdain. You don't think in anything else, you only want to create awesome work. Once I got out and saw what I did the fear started to sip in, I said to myself ""wtf did I just do?! I could have died"". But the results where too shinny to be afraid for too long.

Passion helps you go through anything. I bet that's how you feel when you are in a war zone taking pictures or in any dangerous situation. It's something only people with that kind of passion can understand.",2020-10-05T22:26:52Z,43

However when she was diagnosed with COPD and had her first major attack of not being able to breathe I saw fear like never before in her eyes. I saw her cry for the first time. She was completely panicked by not being able to catch her breath.  She said it felt as though she was under water and given a straw, that's a nightmare!
She truly changed as a person after that. She actually told me she loved me for the first time and many times over. I really wish my mom was alive because that's all she ever wanted was her mother's love, I think it helped put her in an early grave.

I told her months prior that it was a bad idea and told her not to do it. She said the place had wonderful reviews and everyone in the Facebook group was happy and it was ""better care than you'd get at a hospital here in the US."" A week before she left, I saw a news article of a woman who had the exact procedure done and then returned to the US and died a few days later from complications. My mom can't be reasoned with or told that she's wrong, so she told me to shut up and let her do what she wanted. Well, during the surgery the doctor improperly tied off a major blood vessel. The ligature came loose and my mom bled out internally. She was only found and saved because she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway from hypovolemia. She had no blood pressure cuff or heart rate monitor on her in surgery recovery. There was nobody monitoring her in her private room, she was just laying in bed unsupervised. After they found her in the hallway, they rushed her back to surgery and sucked out almost 2 liters of blood and tied the vessel off again. They gave her 3 or 4 units of packed red cells and she was still anemic. The doctor said her internals we're ""greasy and fatty which caused the ligature to fall off."" He said she was ""fattier than a good steak"" and she should never eat carbs again. Gaslighting. üôÑ Anyway, she got back home a few days later and had to have a blood test done for alllllllll the communicable blood borne diseases because of the Mexican blood transfusions. Then when she went to the FB group to tell about her experience, they immediately deleted her post and banned her from the group. The reason she saw no bad reviews and horror stories like that is because it was heavily censored. I didn't even need to say ""I told you so."" She knew. She knew, and it killed that narcissistic personality of hers. If I was her, I'd have gone to my PCP and requested a referral to a GI doc and asked them for an abdominal MRI to make sure they didn't screw up anything else. Incapable of tying off a simple blood vessel correctly, I wonder if they left an instrument in there or created an artificial diverticulum or something bizarre. Can't tell that woman anything. She knows best, she knows everything. üôÑ Worst of all, when I said ""Yeah, you almost died"" she just responded with ""Lots of things have almost killed me in my life and I beat every one of 'em.

The luxury items and the money is usually owned by the higher ups, family members of the cartel boss or key people within the cartel. These higher ups don't engage in narco gunfights, they only give out orders. 

The average member of the cartel is usually the one who takes the biggest risks for the lowest payout.  

Example: On Monday you joined because the cartel offered you $1k and by Thursday you are already dead because of a gunfight or you came out as one of the names in a narco interrogation. 

Not everyone in the cartel is a ""soldier"" many work handling the drugs/money, others work carrying the product, money or guns from point A to point B. Then there are the halcones in towns to keep an eye out for police and rival cartel movement. The average street dealer and the soldier or ""Sicario"". 

Depending on the region in Mexico you are in and the cartel that controls that area, a Mexican can be forced to join the cartel or can willingly join for salaries of 1-3k a month. Being a transporter of product or packaging drugs in a city like Culiac√°n is relatively safe compared to being a soldier fighting to take or defend a territory or plaza. Add the poor training, been drugged or drunk right before a gunfight and it is clear why cartels are always in need for more soldiers. Most cartel soldiers don't reach the 5 year mark, they die or go to prison. In really hot plazas or disputed territories, soldiers don't last a week after being recruited. 


The narco propaganda is probably one of the most efective and powerful in the world. It offers the illusion of a life of luxury for joining a cartel, but in reality the cartel members sign their lives away to be used as cannon fodder to make the cartel boss and the higher ups richer.",2023-06-10T20:52:42Z,97

However, I think it is not productive to start the conversation saying that men should have absolutely no say in the abortion debate. Let me explain: Pro-life advocates (whether you like it or not) do not see this issue as a woman's body issue. They see it as protecting life, and they would state that everyone (men and women) has a right to protect life. Abortion is a philosophical debate at its core and telling men to not weigh in on an issue that directly affects the society they live in instantly shuts them off from listening to the rest of your argument.

I believe in equal protection of the law. This video prompted me to post the following: Abortion - The Hyde Amendment has been in the news this week because of candidate Biden‚Äôs recent comments. Over the years, I‚Äôve heard the Hyde Amendment described as the ‚ÄúGold Standard‚Äù for pro-life legislation. And that, my friends, prompts me to think of that old adage ‚ÄúAll that glitters is not gold‚Äù. The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal funds when it comes to paying for abortions. The Hyde Amendment always specifies some circumstances where it‚Äôs ok to use federal funds to pay for abortion. Please contrast this to the clear language of our Constitution: No person shall be deprived of their life without due process. The Constitution doesn‚Äôt allow for any exceptions. The Hyde Amendment does. Look up the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù in your favorite dictionary. A person is an individual human being. Bible believers have long known that we‚Äôre all persons, including when in our mother‚Äôs womb. Science has caught up in recent years. DNA wasn‚Äôt discovered until 1957. We‚Äôve learned enough about DNA to know that you‚Äôve been an individual human being since the very beginning of your biological development. I‚Äôd be opposed to abortion even if the Constitution was silent on the matter. But the Constitution is not silent. The Hyde Amendment codifies exceptions that the Constitution does not allow. Please stop supporting candidates, even those who call themselves pro-life, and even those who get highest rating from groups like National Right to Life, if the candidate votes to codify depriving ANY person of their life without due process. In most elections, none of the candidates on the ballot measure up on this matter. Let‚Äôs change that, the sooner the better.

I love that they made such a touchy subject so ‚Äúfun‚Äù. However this felt very ‚ÄúVice‚Äù. The form of mockery in describing the ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù or the consistent association of ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù to the Qanon movement is apparent. Believing that the ultra wealthy meet in private to discuss how they will shift the world is not far-fetched anymore when you look how many things in society have changed in the last couple of years. The Qanon movement is over exaggerated and honestly over praising Trump when in reality he‚Äôs not saving any of us. This association immediately makes people look dumb and discredits ALL critical thought. 

These subtle associations of people who question the ultra wealthy who aren‚Äôt as nice as these Miami bachelors is the very reason there‚Äôs such a huge disconnect between those in power and those collecting food stamps. Again I give credit to the lighthearted-ness of the documentary. But there‚Äôs still a level of backhanded-ness to those who actually do the research and those who just let it go because Vice labels these people as kids with trust funds ‚Äújust living their best lives‚Äù. 

The rawness that we would want on topics like secret societies and the Bohemian Grove will never truly be brought to light because Alex Jones is the crazy poster boy and the super wealthy own VICE lol.

My oldest daughter just graduated from University a couple of years ago and bought her first home, with her fiance, for just under $1 million. This is just a medium sized (1800 ft¬≤) 3 bedroom bungalow on the outskirts (1 hour drive to the city) of a medium sized city; nothing special.

To compare things, my parents bought a slightly larger home home, much closer to the city center, in 1970 for less than $35k, while earning $32k per year (single income and 2 years out of university too).

The reality is that today house prices have become absolutely insane. My daughter and her fiance are both engineers but their combined income is only a little over 1/10th of the price of the home they bought. It will take them a very long time to pay it off.

My father on the other hand, back in 1970, was able to buy 2 new cars, fully furnish their home with new furniture, travel to Europe on vacation with the entire 4 member family every 2 to 3 years, etc.

Back in the 70's prices for everything, especially expensive things, were roughly 1/10th the percentage of your income compared to today.

Another example, a brand new mid sized car with AC cost $2200 on that $32,000 salary. Today for a similar class car you'd pay closer to $40,000 on a salary of under $60,000. So salaries have less than doubled or 1.8x, while car prices have gone up by 18x.

One really strange fact is from 1935 until 1970 taxes on higher income earners were between 90% to 98%. Today taxes are a much smaller fraction of your income, especially for the rich.

How is it possible that 35 years of high taxes took things from the great depression (when rich people, like CEOs earned 1000+x more than a worker) to 1970 where CEOs only earned 2 to 3x an average worker.

Today though, with low taxes again, we are back to the rich bringing in 1000+x more again.

What gives?",2022-03-15T07:41:50Z,6

Almost every family i know including ours has had loses on all sides that's why we were forced at some point to use violence to protect ourselves from all different sides.. i wish we could lock all extremists on an island down and leave them there until they kill each others and those who just want to live peacefully all around the world can stay together and revolutionise the way mankind unite and grow.",2020-02-22T11:59:28Z,2

I use to ask him like why wasn‚Äôt he scared about going back to prison. And basically he told me every time he went to prison, he had friends already there, since he was a hustler who liked to share all his ‚Äúearnings‚Äù he was well liked by everyone. He told me he would do things like get close with a female guard to smuggle in things like cigarettes and he would just give the cigs to everyone in his cell block or when he was out in the yard. So he said he always felt like Robin Hood just coming back to his people when he would go back to prison. My cousin could have honestly been some huge business tycoon but he came to the US as a teen, with an accent, and bullied everyday. So where do you turn to in those situations when you live in LA back in the 90s? You turn to the gangs who offered brotherhood and protection. My cousin is doin well tho, he got deported back to the Philippines where I hear he has turned over a new leaf and has a new family there. His two sons here are grown and doin amazing things with their lives. But yeah long story short, prison is tough and scary for a lot of people, but the flip side of that is the prison system is not doin enough to change lives for the better. My cousin should have done more to learn from his bad decisions in life, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. Regardless of that, these privatized prison industries just need to be abolished",2024-02-02T16:47:12Z,110

This has been around for as long as online purchases have been a thing. When I first became aware of it in the early/mid 90s, you could get lists of cards and card generators from AOL chat rooms and warez sites. Back then, banks and websites hadn't caught up to the security aspect of it yet so there weren't things like the 3 digit code on the back, security questions, or even SSL. If you had the card number and expiration date, that's all you needed. And card companies used simple algorithms to generate numbers. So, people wrote programs to generate their own card numbers and exps and you could just try them until you found a combination that worked. It's not hacking. It's just theft.

I work hospice in the villages and a reality that needs to be touched on is dying in the villages. End of life usually includes using up your last dollars since you've spent so much to the villages itself. Most patients go bankrupt at death and end up in an oven. Being away from family, it's usually up to us to sit with them and they're by themselves. It becomes an end of generational wealth or leaving something behind, because they sold their homestead to move here. Everything you have left gets taken for your healthcare. While you're living it up and spending money on restaurants and nonsense, you still have to pay your healthcare costs. Your house gets sold to someone else and it's like you were never there. After your death there's usually HOA fines or fees that have to be paid and that gets taken out of your home sale because you didn't upkeep your home in the hospital and interest compounded. I've seen so many of these people completely broke at their death. All of them usually end up getting cremated and there's stacks of them.

For fun, I ride my bike, kayak with a Meet Up group, hike, camp, swim. I enjoy working and socializing with people of mixed ages.

There are some here who mentioned the accumulation of wealth in the boomers does may not extend to future generations who may not be able to afford ‚ÄúThe Villages.‚Äù This an excellent point. The assumption of ‚ÄúThe Villages‚Äù is that this lifestyle is perpetual and, in fact, it is not. People get old and sick and die. Someone has to replace them and be able to fund the life too. If people are strapped with debt and pensions are not what they once had been then how can ‚ÄúThe Villages‚Äù succeed? Like the collapse of Malls ‚ÄúThe Villages‚Äù is not immune to changing times and you can only be old so long before it‚Äôs time to leave this earth so what happens when growth slows? ‚ÄúThe Villages‚Äù is like a movie set.

Very conservative, lots of drinking, lots of golf and pickleball.  I didn't come across too many gun enthusiasts though.  

The big thing about The Villages is that it's about convenience.  You don't have to be active and it's not a small community (about 110,000 residents) so you don't have to worry about everybody knowing your business.  But if you have plans for the day to go see the doctor in the morning, play golf and have lunch afterward with friends, go home take a nap, then go to the pool and then have dinner...you can do all of that with a simple hop in a golf cart.  

The one thing I do wonder about is how sustainable all of this is.  Younger generations, even my generation (Gen X) either don't have the wealth or have far more debt than the boomer generation and the Millenials and Gen Z are going to be even worse off.  There's also the generational conflict of what works for Boomer won't work for Gen X.  It wouldn't shock me if The Villages is a ghost town in 25 years.",2022-10-20T08:01:49Z,1538

The question I always ask myself is this; When did we accept adults making choices that were clearly irresponsible? 

Growing up it was bombarded into my head to be responsible. Take responsibility for your actions and respect ones action in how they effect other people. But yet somehow it seems there has been a radical shift in holding those responsible for making these poor choices accountable.

I am speaking from my perspective in the US, and let me say I am truly sorry for how piss poor many of our leaders are. I shoulder a great responsibility for their lack of empathy and conduct. I know it is not my fault, but it is more my fault than any other human due to the fact that on paper we use a ""democracy"" but that does not take away from the pain in knowing the truth.

Keep up the good work, I do feel the best course of action is to educate everyone until we can all agree. If not maybe we need to flat out hog tie some representatives and pull them into a public space and set some examples for what we expect them to do. I do not advocate violence, but something needs to be done.",2019-09-21T20:49:19Z,14

TPS to me seems like an allowance to stay in a country, a temporary citizenship, while your home is being rebuild by others or something. So basically, when your own country is repaired to a point where you actually can live in it again, one is sent back/ required to go back. 
If I got this part right then they technically can't complain about being sent back as this condition was known from the beginning.
I mean, I understand their standpoint, they live there for almost 2 decades and all that and no one would probably notice a difference if they got a permanent citizenship and they surely can ask the state with big, watery eyes and all that but they can't demand one as they don't have the right to one.

1. The hard, rock-like materials we build our roads, buildings, and parking lots are great for soaking up and storing heat energy. And, at night, they release that heat energy back into he air to keep temperatures elevated. Deserts and xeriscapes do not have the heat storage capacity of asphalt, concrete and cement. There isn't much heat stored, so there isn't much heat to release back into the atmosphere. Because of this, building solar cover over man-made structures (like buildings and parking lots) can help shade materials to help restore a more natural day-night heat cycle. (This is a small part of why Phoenix's summers have gotten so bad lately.)

2. Desert landscapes are more suited towards wind farms over solar. Vast, wide open stretches of land where winds can blow? While wind farms do require large chunks of land, they don't required anywhere near as much land to be put to the bulldozer. Most of the land in a windfarm can be maintained as native and wild. Sure, the windmill is a hazard to birds, but it's a problem windmill makers are working on. And wind's unreliability is different from solar's unreliability, so they can be paired to produce more power at different times of day. (Rural wind farms with Urban solar farms.)

I wish I had the money to start a company that leases parking lots to make dual use solar farms. I would put my money where my mouth is.",2023-09-29T14:35:15Z,3

(Note: the definition of ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù is shifting as the evolving virus makes boosters increasingly important!) 

Portugal‚Äôs strategy was, in part, to give the vaccine effort a non-political face: a military officer named Henrique Gouveia e Melo. He‚Äôs very tall, wears a combat uniform everywhere he goes, and enforced a strictly non-political communications strategy. He approached the vaccine effort like a military mission and by all accounts, gained the trust of the nation. It certainly wasn‚Äôt the only factor in Portugal‚Äôs success, but it made me wonder whether a military-led approach could have helped reduce polarization in the US.

‚Ä¢ Valuation problem: How do you appropriately value assets at the scale required? What about shares that aren't publicly traded, antiques, arts, and anything else of value?

‚Ä¢ Liquidity problem: The wealth of almost all wealthy people is primarily held in non-liquid assets and the capital generated by those assets may not even cover the wealth tax bill.

Consider a company like Amazon that is notoriously a low-profit business. In 2017 its profits were $3bn, which is less than Bezos' entire wealth tax bill under Warren's proposals and of course Bezos would only have access to the portion that represents his ownership of the company. It's not enough.

The consequence of this is mass asset sales. In order to raise capital to pay the wealth tax, assets owned by the wealthy will have to be sold. And who would be purchasing these assets--shares or possessions--when they're sold? People wealthy enough to afford them will likely be in the same position as the seller and trying to sell their own assets to raise cash. Those wealthy enough but below the threshold of the tax may avoid buying because such a purchase may take them over the threshold and result in them also having to pay the wealth tax. The people wealthy enough to buy up such assets without incurring the wealth tax will be non-American investors. In other words, US assets being purchased by foreign investors.

The global tax system needs to be fixed, mainly through simplification and clear international rules that are fit for a world in which e-commerce and the internet exists, and there's certainly a case to be made about how government can best collect revenue. But taxing assets regardless of if and how much capital they generate in between transactions seems unworkable and likely will have so many unintended consequences",2019-03-06T23:28:16Z,332

This would be a good point in the video to cover the US estate tax. It's... technically applied to the amount inherited, which is not taxed as capital gains. But it's only applied at all to individuals with estates worth over $5.3 Million, or couples worth twice that much, and only to amounts beyond that amount.
Naturally, one of our political parties has been working hard to make the estate tax apply to fewer and fewer people, with the goal of eventually eliminating it.
The estate tax is the small note worth mentioning for this portion of the video. But it really needs to be emphasized that the federal estate tax only applies to about 0.1% of estates in the US, leaving this video accurate on capital gains remaining untaxed in an estate an overwhelming portion of the time (not 99.9%, since there's often nothing to inherit here.)",2022-02-21T13:25:55Z,6

For a long time, there's been weight on the backs of teachers disproportionate to the amount of wealth or prestige that job takes in. The job has been, for awhile, in most places, a 'passion' job. You go there not because you want a lucrative career, but because you feel like you could really help stir up that inquisitive spark in the next generation of students. Ultimately, that seems like a rather noble goal, right? Yet, for the most part, the general attitude towards teachers seems to lean more towards playing the role of glorified babysitter, and the constant pressure on that job to improve, to break out of the shell of 'standards' (yet still totally adhere to them so schools keep accreditation, funding, etc), while people try to break up their unions.

In other words, your job as a teacher is to play surrogate parent, create the next generation of Einsteins, and avoid getting shit on the whole time from all sides, all while doing so with possibly out of date materials, underfunded programs, or a myriad of other hurdles set in your path to doing your job as its expected of you. Now, when we talk about 'struggling education' these days, we're not talking about the top tier educations. Our smartest of the smart are still super smart (maybe they have a little more competition nowadays), we're talking about the lower end getting bigger. Which really means we're talking about the income inequality issue as well, as more folks becoming poorer not only affects the ability of the child to learn in the home, but it hurts the tax base that funds those schools, creating this double whammy of bad situations for those that most need a high-quality education.

What they're addressing here is that, you cannot simply heap yet another issue onto the shoulders of an already overly taxed profession, while treating them like their job is the most important step in the entire social chain to adulthood (and subsequently paying them less than the manager of some retail store far less important to the health of the nation.)

If you were fighting a disease, and the best way to treat it was to do a myriad of treatments to fully eradicate it, would you simply choose the cheapest treatment, depend heavily upon it, and expect it to work just as well as the multifaceted solution?",2014-09-06T18:30:35Z,48

If I imagine myself being a native, I can easily see why I would rather not have my country flooded with ""other"" people, especially if these ""other"" people are going to disrupt my way of life

Otoh, if I imagine myself as an immigrant, who is doing nothing wrong except trying to seek out a better life for myself and my children, I can also easily see how being denied due to my race/religion/cultural background can feel deeply unjust

We could of course try to implement a very robust system in order to govern the immigration process to ensure that everyone is given a fair chance, but that just leads to resources being diverted to this purpose, when said resources could have been better used elsewhere, and it also just encourages people who do not qualify to immigrate illegally, which brings about a whole other set of problems

Truthfully, if I were the king of my own country, and is faced with this dilemma, I wouldn't know what to do either

Perhaps some kind of system whereby immigrants are accepted quite generously without bias or prejudice, but they then in return has to agree to provide some sort of service to the country that benefits its existing citizens and the country, be it in the military, the civil service, the labour work force, community service, etc before they can fully earn the right for them, and more importantly their children, to live in this country

This way, everyone gets a fair shot. Someone highly skilled, such as a doctor, can be made to donate his time to give out free medical service to he poor, while someone less skilled can be made to work hard on any of the ""3 D"" jobs that are important to society, all for a set amount of time, say 10 years

That way, once they are done serving their new country like this, no one can say they don't deserve to be here, while existing citizens would have reaped the benefit of their service, so everyone should be square with each other",2018-03-20T19:36:02Z,34

I just want to clarify one thing. Sigal Samuel says, toward the end of the video, that ""it is entirely possible for us to have a meat production system that is better for human health as well as for the climate and the animals themselves. We just need to abandon factory farming to get that."" Earlier in the video, she says that 90% of meat worldwide and 99% of US meat comes from CAFOs. And the video shows the tremendous rise in meat production. The facts are there, but I think it is important to make it clear that the utopia-like idea Samuel puts forth that it is possible to eat meat without the harm currently caused by the meat industry would require a drastic reduction of meat in global diets, especially in high-consuming countries such as the US.

Many were floated around. Better policing, stricter punishment for criminals, a growing economy and a myriad of other reasons. But the true reason was the Roe v Wade decision in 73 that made abortions legal for all in the USA. This led to women of colour, of poor economic background, material abusers and all others who had unwanted or unplanned pregnancies get an abortion. But before that, they had to have a child. And that child was more likely to become a criminal because of the mother's background and subsequent parenting. hence crime was in a growth. but by late 80's, the children who would have been born if abortion wasn't legalized would be in their late teens. An age where they would be at their criminal peak committing violent crimes. This led to low criminal population in all. hence the drop in crime rates. 
Its true that overturning Roe v Wade sent USA by 50 years. But in 20 years, if it isnt overturned back again, we will see higher crimes and more violent crimes.",2022-07-09T08:21:51Z,134

(1) One of the main considerations was that stopping gas flows would be more damaging to Russia than to Germany (which is still true) as Russia depends on gas sales, although they make 3/4 of their ressource money from oil sales. Little consideration was given to the possibility that Russia might not care about their economy at all.
(2) Germany has 3 main suppliers (Norway, Netherlands and Russia) and both Norway and the Netherlands will still increase deliveries in the short term.
(3) Gas is used in Germany almost equally for heating and for industrial processes and unlike shown in the video, mainly in the chemicals sector. The world's largest chemicals company is sitting at the southern end of this pipeline network, producing e.g. fertilizer for agicultural production, which is also exported. And legally the industrial companies would be the ones that would have to limit their consumption, not the private households.
(4) Almost no gas is used for power production, that's why the exit from nuclear is quite irrelevant in this debate.
(5) Since the beginning of the war, Germany has exited both coal and oil from Russia and cut its share of the gas supply from 55% down to 30%.",2022-05-23T18:07:05Z,137

Russian gas is the cheapest option for Germany due to it's geographical proximity. The gas can be pipped to German plants directly. This is a big part of how Germany was able to get so wealthy and sustain it's massive industry. It's also why there is such a reluctance in Germany to detach itself from Russian gas. Germany can replace Russian energy but it will be more expensive for them. At least in the short - medium term.,2022-05-19T07:25:07Z,824

The country is almost the worst country in all of America, second only to Haiti. The violence here is unreal, so present in people's lives that one of the newspapers is nicknamed 'Muerto Diario', Dead Newspaper, for the amount of murders that appear on it. I live in a pretty safe area of my town, and even I see the poverty and violence on a daily basis. My mother was robbed not a minute after she left our house. My best friend lives in one of the most impoverished and violent barrios in town, and they see a shootout almost every week. Our people are incompetent because they don't get to go to school. People live in landfills, and are excited when they find rotting food in the trash. It doesn't help that our leaders are corrupt and the main industry is drug trafficking. These are the reasons people try to escape from the country and look for a better life in other countries. Visas expire, airplane tickets are expensive, and applying for residency is near impossible, and people know this, so illegal immigration is their only option. If the crackdown doesn't stop, all these poor people will end up dead. These changes should help peole seeking new lives, not doom them. The gangs in these countries control everything, and if they find out you tried to escape them, you and your family is as good as dead. So many people are looking for shelter, and if they get that right denied, these people will lose all hope and succumb to violence, and join it. I do not support illegal immigration, all I'm saying is it should be safer and easier for people to make these journeys to find a better life.

Edit: We're having elections right now, and if this woman Sandra Torres wins the elections, there's a good chance that Guatemala will fall to Socialism. My family and I are percieved as extremely wealthy because of our family history, even though we're not, so we are really threatened by invasions or robberies, and with the government turning a blind eye, the narcos could do whatever they want.

Violence and corruption in Mexico are heavily supported by the influx of money and firearms coming from the US, their unwillingness to tackle drug demand at home and the political pressure they put on Mexican authorities to implement these quick-fixes to such complex problems. In the chaos, poor people and normal civilians are the ones to pay the toll.

""It's on sidelines in Italy"", isn't it? No, Italian football and Italian teams aren't sponsored by Gazprom. That picture shows SSC Napoli's striker Arkadiusz Milik. SSC Napoli is an Italian team but during Serie A games you cannot see those sidelines. This picture was taken on 10th December (Napoli-Genk 4-0, hat trick for Milik) because it was the only match-day he managed to score during this Champions League campaign until now. In fact, Gazprom is Champions League's official sponsor, just like other trademarks, such as Heineken and Mastercard. In the same way, you can't find Mastercard and Heineken watching an Italian championship game. The phrase ""It's on sidelines in Italy"", generally speaking, implies that we're talking about Serie A and not only Champions League games played in Italy (Champions League sponsors are shown everywhere, also in Cyprus or Azerbaijan if teams like Apoel or Qarabag are qualified for the tournament).

The professor told us to stop looking at the US as one big country and instead look at it as an amalgamation on 50 different countries with each of their own cultures, problems, and approaches to solutions.

Things we were also taught to consider is diversity density, and general population cultural integration of said diversity.

The TL;DR of that lecture was that gun violence can‚Äôt be solved as a copy/paste solution as to what other countries have done, and gun violence is just a downfall for the US while other countries have downfalls in other categories. Overall, its summarized as comparing the US to other countries regarding gun violence is like comparing Apples to Oranges and we shouldn‚Äôt be comparing other countries to it due to the overwhelming factors that research is often glossed over.

We've now added professional translations for Spanish, Portuguese, and Hindi.

You can access them by hitting the cog icon > subtitles/CC > and selecting the language of your choice. 

Unfortunately since YouTube discontinued the community translation tool last fall we haven't been able to accept translations from viewers, but we're looking into ways to fill this gap. For now, our goal is to hire professional translators where we can. 

We welcome your thoughts and feedback on how we can improve this process and we want to know: which language translations would be the most important to you?

Prisoners are profitable, especially in private prisons. Not to mention profits have been used to sway prosecutors or judges to convict those of non violent or low-grade crimes and have them subjected to harsh punishment, such as the Kids For Cash Scandal. I don't know about federal prison, but private prisons are especially brutal in dehumanizing prisoners and juveniles as young as 13. Their goal isn't to rehabilitate inmates, but to generate and maintain the highest profits through them. They do this by cutting costs, such as security, food, and healthcare and generating arbitrary laws and rule to get more convicted. They have driven the mass incarceration in the U.S sky high, harming families, communities and state governments. With the stocks booming since Trump won the election, private prisons around the country will  be opening their gates for immigrants, and then closing them forever.
U.S corporations have been financially exploiting anything they see as profitable, but this should be off limits. It basically says that your very lives and futures aren't as important as the money they can make off of you.

You do realize the point of the video is that it becomes your whole life you are making up for one mistake right? Hell, in this day and age, you can be wrongly convicted and just because your name pops up in news articles when they do a background check it can screw you over for life.

Plus, what if you did do the crime? Does that mean you should be doomed to struggle for the rest of your life? Why, as a country, we are so pro-punishment and care very little about rehabilitation? Either way, as tax payers, it will come out of our pocket. One method does nothing for the offender and sets them up to be habitual offenders, the homeless people you ignore on the streets, or those who live the rest of their life in misery with a low paying job and no real ladder to get out of the hole.

Meanwhile, rehabilitation would actually lead to opportunity. Because, let's face it, most crimes aren't because the person was bad but their environment lacked opportunity. This is especially the case for those who live in urban populations where lack of funding meant your high school diploma truly did mean nothing. Not just because it is a certificate of attendance, more than anything, but it barely prepared you for community college.

I mean, I get everyone feels as if, if it doesn't affect you, doesn't deal with your loved ones, why should you care? Well, realize that these people, or their descendants, may end up interacting or part of your family.

We, the innocent, free people on the outside, pay for these people for the duration of their punishment- whether it's paying the salary and paperwork of a parol officer, or the basic needs of a prisoner, at thousands of dollars per person per year. 

The point, theoretically, is to emphasize the severity of their misdeeds and inflict a sort of humane suffering onto them, so those misdeeds are never repeated. So they are ""rehabilitated"" through guilt and boredom alone, and eventually resume life as a contributing member of society, and do not cause the state nor it's citizens any more suffering.

Of course, if their record keeps them from obtaining gainful employment, they are then, again, a burden to the state. If they cannot find affordable housing, or a (responsible) loan for a car, how can they even begin their life again? A lucky man will have a family rich and patient enough to support them through the hard times. A desperate man would turn to illegal means of earning a living- at least to get started. At least to support their own goddamn family, who would take their sorry ass in when they can't even get a job. And once they get caught? We have to pay for their punishment all over again.

My point being: if we want to perpetually punish the convicted for the rest of their lives, we are doing so at our own risk. We make their very existence a burden on their families,  and put a heavy pressure on them to earn a  living outside of the law. We, at the very least, have not created the conditions to allow them to ""start again"", with anything less than a herculean effort. Perhaps if fewer offenses could result in jail time or if sentences  weren't so long,  it could result in less crowded jails with more funding and guards, and less inside crime. Perhaps if insisted on anti-discriminatory laws for convicts who have been gainfully employed and clean for X number of months or years, so they could one day have hope of moving up in the world without fearing it would all come crashing down, they would have a powerful reason to grit their teeth for minimum wage untill X amount of time passes. I don't claim to have the answers, but at the very least, this much seems obvious: by perpetually punishing the convicted, we are also hurting our own society.",2017-03-16T12:47:09Z,315

My take: The justice system has become the legal expression of the inherent bullying culture in US American society. What else can you call perpetually punishing someone -- after they've paid their dues and time -- other than bullying?

Some crimes are obviously reprehensible, such as murder, rape and molestation, but the system also makes criminal so many inconsequential actions that all citizens are likely at risk of committing a crime by accident. And in accidentally committing such a crime so, we risk being unduly punished. How is that not anything other than state-sanctioned, institutionalized bullying? It's the state saying ""I don't like what you you've done, so you will be punished -- and I will make the rules so esoteric and dynamic that you'll often not know till it's too late."" 

To add to it all, consider that there's an entire class of people who can evade the consequences of their own crimes, all the while tormenting entire swaths of society with their arbitrary rules: What was the 2008 housing crash? A full on evasion of the justice system by a small group of people with the power, wealth, and influence to do what they want without consequence. Bullies of the highest degree. Don't get me started on for-profit prison systems.

Some -- the poor in particular -- suffer more than others in the short term (if you can call decades ""short term""), but the entire society suffers in the long run.",2017-03-16T17:50:02Z,24

Whether you like it or not, abortion will always happen. Making it illegal won't stop it by any means. Actually, we did do that in the past and women just started to preform self-induced abortions, which might I add are unsafe and can be fatal.

You might be saying, then have a harsher punishment or crackdown on them more. But that just won't work and it really isn't even possible to crackdown on abortion if it's illegal.

So, TL;DR - if abortion is always going to happen, legal or illegal, at least legalize so it can be regulated and performed in a sanitary facility by trained medical professionals instead of at home with a coathanger.

(If you didn't catch it this idea is similar to that of ending the War on Drugs, regulation > criminalization)",2016-04-30T13:01:53Z,1691

It's about the question at which point the foetus is a human being. And there is no scientific answer to that. Most people would agree that in the beginning, when it's only one cell, it's not a human being, and most people would agree that the moment before the baby gets born, it is already a human being. But at which point exactly we say now it's a human being is hard to find. I think we could says when the heart starts beating, although I admit that it is objectively seen a relatively arbitrary point and it's more of an emotional thing that I would say that it becomes a human at that point. Furthermore does the embryo already look very human relatively early during the pregnancy, so I don't really know either at which point it should be limited.

Also I think there is generally nothing wrong with putting restrictions on it, though you need to look into every single restriction to see which ones are bad or good. For example the one with the ultrasound picture of the foetus. I think that is a good thing. Nobody forces them to see the picture, they are simply asked if they want to see it, and I think you should look at the thing you are about to ""kill"" (I used it for lack of a better word).

The more important steps tho to decrease the numbers of abortion are sex ed, teaching kids more about protection and increasing access to protection",2018-08-19T15:44:06Z,2

We have many places in the world that have had or are facing zero days. In Australia, we have a '""water buyback"" scheme for the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia's food bowl. Which stretches from Queensland through NSW all the way to Victoria). It was meant to be a way of balancing the use of water by limiting the volume of water that farmers could extract from the river. The government 'buys back' water entitlements from growers, thereby reducing the amount of water taken from the river. 

Now you don't need to be a farmer to own water entitlements, in fact the Chinese and the US are the biggest investors in our water entitlements. The government was caught paying $80 million of tax payers money to company that is registered to the Cayman Islands.

Last year during our summer (which is very dry) water stopped flowing in the rivers causing large blue-green algae blooms which starved oxygen to all the fish. Millions of fish were killed and seen floating in the river. While there was a drought and lot of finger pointing on to blame, what we need to remember is that the basin can only support so much. Why are we growing things like cotton, chestnuts and rice? Things that require so much water. We should be growing things that suit our climate.

And when we do eat out, instead of enjoying it I feel stressed and guilty over how much it costs. Gas is... close to where you would expect it had we not experienced COVID inflation, but it's still not where it should be. We used to have enough extra money to save up and go on an out of state/country vacation every 1-2 years, but we haven't been able to do that the past three years. So in spite my income going up about 17%, it's been more than negated by the rise in the cost of living. We SHOULD be doing better than ever. And yet, we're not.

The first was that farmers historically would over produce and then go broke. It was also obvious that surplus crop production was essential as a hedge against emergencies. It takes up to 2 years to ""change course"" on farm production.

So, farmers gained a price support system. They were paid to not grow certain crops in some years, and paid to grow surplus in other years. The surplus food was rotting in the fields. This price ""support"" stabilized production a bit over market need, and avoided bankrupt farmers if prices collapsed. Harvesting the surplus was the next logical step. This was the origin of the Federally supported School Lunch programs in 1946. (These replaced 1930s programs abandoned during the war.)

In the 1950s the now obvious idea was to give poor people access to that surplus food that was being grown, and tossed. The solution was to give poor people ""food stamps"" they could use to buy food that would otherwise be left to rot. Their health was improved, farmers were more financially secure, and the surplus production capacity was maintained. That was the origin of food stamps under the administrations of Truman, and also expanded under Eisenhower. In 1969 the Nixon administration expanded the program again, and added some restrictions to eligibility. This was the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 

The new SNAP food stamps cost us nothing extra from the existing agricultural production price controls. The school nutrition programs cost us nothing extra from the existing agricultural production price controls.

NOTHING! Farmers would be paid regardless.

The Republican urge to return to the Bad Old Days is not merely cruel, it is destructive.",2023-09-14T01:37:55Z,75

Everyone who is objective needs to consider the following (a} no Palestinian lives would have been lost or injured but for the decision of Hamas to massacre over 1200 Israelis with almost all of them being civilians and (b) even after the massacre Hamas knew it could avoid the loss of Palestinian lives by being willing to return the 100-150 hostages in return for a ceasefire prior the even the first Israeli air strike . Hamas was fully aware that Israel would be required to respond with air strikes and blockades and moreover that this would result in a far great loss of life of their own people as compared to returning the hostages.  They also knew that to continue holding the hostages would force Israel into a ground operation which would result in the loss of more Israeli and Palestinian lives.  AGAIN -  no Palestinians had to die if Hamas had slaughtered Israelis . AGAIN- even with that no Palestinians had to die if Hamas returned the hostages in return for a ceasefire.  Hamas chose to keep the hostages rather than value the lives of the residents of Gaza . Those who try to defend the conduct or condone the loss of Israeli lives by making claims regarding past Israeli conduct always selectively omit the fact that it always arose after Hamas had engaged in terrorist attacks ( suicide bombings etc ) and the firing of rockets which led Israel to respond with air strikes and blockades. If there were no rockets being fired at Israeli towns and cities then Israel would not have had to conduct air strikes and blockades. It is very telling that those that try to rationalize or condone the actions never express a wish that there could be peace or state that it is sad that any civilians died . Consider that in the last 15 years Hamas received billions of dollars to buy rockets from Iran then consider if Hamas had used those billions to better the lives of the residents of Gaza rather than buy rockets ( again keep in mind if no rockets are fired at Israeli towns and cities then no air strikes or blockaded ).  None of the actions of Hamas over the past 15 years have bettered the lives of residents of Gaza but rather it has led to deaths of thousands of their own people and led to the worsening of the conditions for the living.  To really understand the conduct of Hamas an objective person has to look at their mission goal which is the eradication of Israel. They refuse to accept the right of Israel to exist even within the confines of the 1948 borders ( which Israel offered to the Palestinians numerous times in the 1980s). Accordingly , Hamas does not care that their actions lead to a great loss of life to the residents of Gaza because they are not interested in peace and sadly they see their own civilians deaths as grist for the PR mill . The reason they would not give the hostages back is very simple ‚Äì they wanted to have Israel launch a ground invasion because they want more dead on both sides so that the cycle of war and hate continues rather than having a peace since that would mean having to accept Israel .  Those that choose to condone the actions of Hamas with respect to the events of the past week obviously have no moral compass nor do they support any idea of peace or desire any peace that does not involve the eradication of Israel .  Unlike them, I do mourn the loss of the lives of Palestinian civilians and wish that the leaders and supporters of Hamas valued the lives of those civilians more than killing Israelis /Jews and chose to spend money bettering the lives of those people rather than buying rockets. Indeed, the one thing that they accomplished ( which was certainly deliberate) is to make it impossible for any Israeli government for at least a generation to discuss peace ‚Äì which is what they want ‚Äì because they want the cycle of hate and death to continue. NOTE ‚Äì I support a 2 state peace agreement =I believe most Israelis would be willing to do that just as they did in the 1980s.",2023-10-16T15:16:45Z,13

Thusly, to avert our Social Security accounts, and our social security population numbers, we need to invite immigrants to the country. We need to accept all these good people and let them live and work in this country. Television has beamed the American culture into every home everywhere with a television.

They didn't really sign on to those rules, and those rules haven't defended them much. That said, what they're doing, what they just did, is monstrous, horrific, and something no human society should ever tolerate. Rules or not, we cannot reward such crimes, we cannot tolerate them, we cannot let them expand. When certain lines are crossed there is no forgiveness, discussion, or going back. Yes, talking about Hamas, not those in Gaza - I feel for them, though at the moment, far as I'm concerned, it is Hamas firing every missile that lands on them. Because they triggered this, continued this, made it impossible for any nation attacked in this manner to not respond with overwhelming force, and then they hid behind the civilians there. So hopefully the people of Gaza are either able to find some places of relative safety, or they overthrow Hamas and rescue the hostages before the worst hits that area. *sigh*",2023-10-11T04:08:04Z,9

There is a clear distinction that both President and Vice-President is left OUT as ""cannot hold office"" from Article 3.
It list Congressperson and Senator and Elector of President and VP.  But it does NOT list Office of the President.
See there are some clear distinctions here. A Congressperson and Senator is elected INSIDE a State. Not Federally (Nationally). Same with ""Electors"". But the President is elected NATIONALLY by all people. Not the states. So it's the ""will of the people"" that come into play here.
The 14th Amendment was designed so STATES cannot influence the government which is federal. That is how the civil war insurrection even came about. 

It's ridiculous to make the claim that the ""office of USA"" is what applied to ""President'. It's literally an ELECTED position. ""Officer of USA"" can be appointed. Also why would the highest office be listed as a ""Side-note"" Like ""officer of USA"". It's silly.

They left it open, that technically a person even one that was involved in the insurrection back then could separately run for President and then the PEOPLE decide nationally.  They would account for every citizen which even the people in the southern states are a part of is a citizen and hence have the right to vote.

No one has even been charged with insurrection. So how can you even label it other than ""It's what I feel like"" opinion.

Local states should not be able to decide national federal elections. It disenfranchise voters. And ironically that is what article 3 actually protects when it comes to FEDERAL election of PRESIDENT.
There is a big distinction with congress and Senate since they are elected IN a state not by the citizens of all states.

It takes time for the effects of positive changes add up. Negative things like prices shooting up or losing your job are felt right away and make people nervous long after. In a year or two people will be feeling how good things are on paper now. That helps explain the otherwise baffling cycle I‚Äôve seen my entire life where Democrats slowly build up a great economy over 2 terms, people get used to it and elect a Republican because why not and ‚Äúchange is good,‚Äù the Republican coasts on the good economic momentum they inherited and use the capital to do reckless stuff, the economy inevitably crashes, a Democrat gets reelected and slowly starts fixing things and then faces a bunch of hand/wringing while they‚Äôre trying to get reelected. And then when polled people say the GOP is better on the economy because all they remember is Republican presidents coasting and handing out tax breaks while things are good vs. Democrats  trudging through fearful rebuilding periods.

The delta variant struck that spring and spread rapidly w/ the traveling public - it was like an A-bomb went off in India and the blast radius spread to neighboring Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (whose borders were still mostly closed) ... India became a massive burning funeral pyre for months as bodies piled up from the delta variant... In Bangladesh, graveyards were soon filled w/ markers w/ the year 2021 as year of death... Everything had to be shut down all over again for months until the 'second wave' slowed down. India's rivers literally had dead bodies floating like a parade after they had been dumped from ambulances by families who couldn't afford to cremate their deceased.

We now know that the delta variant was identified in October 2020 in India and its spread was exacerbated worldwide by the lifting of restrictions by Modi's incompetent government... Actual estimates of covid casualties in India are projected to be over 1.5 million deaths.",2023-12-16T11:56:48Z,10

Any teacher can tell you, kids are little germ factories. Whatever sniffle they currently have, teacher will get, Mom and Dad will get, etc. So yeah, school closings were a problem from the point of view of educating kids, right? No-one's denying that. But I remember Texas, where ambulances would have to drive a hundred miles to find an open slot in an ER. I remember Alaska, where there simply weren't enough ERs. Sure, we could have continued the business as usual approach, but I remember pyres of burning bodies in India, right? Stories of people there being sent home to die, even though less-crowded ERs may have been able to save their life.

I guess my interpretation was, ""how DARE you inconvenience me? You're asking ME to make sacrifices! Do you know who I AM?"" It's like half the USA had this big Karen meltdown. 

Yeah, kids were scarred. Kids were scarred by Vietnam, by Watergate, by the world wars. Kids were scarred by the Great Recession and 9/11. Stop whining about the school closures already.",2023-12-16T17:29:52Z,12

After all, Ronald Reagan never asked, ""Are people whom you don't know and there's no reason for you to care about better off than they were four years ago?""  He asked, ""Are YOU better off than YOU were four years ago,"" implying that as long as enough Americans were doing well to elect him, neither they nor he had to actually do anything to help those being left behind compete with those who had already made it.  Lest we forget, he won with 50.7% of the popular vote in 1980 and didn't score a landslide victory until 1984 when the unemployment rate was more than twice what it is today, based on his grandfatherly smile, his cutting remarks dripping with sweetness and a chuckle, and a slogan of ""Morning in America,"" not so different from Trump's ""MAGA.""

Americans have been taught for the last 45 years that the only economy that counts is their own.  Carter tried to sell a modest lifestyle instead of acquisitiveness to the American voter in 1980 to help the country weather the oil shock storm of stagflation and got his head handed to him on a platter.  As a result, even Bernie Sanders explains his proposals in terms of money ($30/hr minimum wage, not going bankrupt due to education or health costs, etc.) rather than what the right thing to do for one's fellow Americans is.

As a result, if you like eggs and the price of eggs goes up, it is taken by some to mean that the president is trying to make their life difficult.  By the way, compared to 1982, when Reagan was president, eggs now cost all of 8¬¢ more per dozen, adjusted for inflation.  And yet because the price may be higher than four years ago, people who think this way say, ""My economy is terrible,"" and then ignore the financial condition of everybody else, whom they've been taught not to care about.  If gas goes up in price, how many of those complaining (forgetting about who is responsible for the price increase) switch to car-pooling, thereby giving up privacy and 20 minutes of sleep, or to public transportation?  ""I don't want to have to ride with the kinds of people who use public transport every day.""  Whose fault is what you want?  The president's?  Why is what you want any more important than what someone else wants? ¬†

Now, if you want to ask why Musk or Bezos don't have to car-pool, why they deserve the fairy-tale lives they have, you have a good question to pose to either of them, or any other super rich person.  You never hear anyone debate Bezos, Musk, etc. on why they think they deserve hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth and a firefighter who saves lives and property doesn't.  (No, I am not a firefighter.)

That's why Biden has trouble communicating the state of the economy to many people.  Those people want him to do something about the state of _their_ economy, though Biden was elected to be president of the USA, not the president of only Joe, Jane and Cindy Schlabotnick or Laverne Bleppy and her kids. Besides, the law does not allow one man to centrally control the economy.  I thought Republicans knew that.",2024-02-06T12:44:40Z,1

The courts wrongly ruled you can wave your right and made speedy trials so speedy the defense could not prepare making almost everyone wave their right. 

So defendant waives their right they then can hold them forever in effect. 

We need to make it the defense not the prosecution that chooses when to go to trial. Prosecution most of the time should be ready to go anytime they charge someone especially for a lot of the crimes these folks involved with there just not that much evidence eather way to require months to prepare. In many cases only days needed. 

Of course attorney for defense should be drafted from the pool of lawyers. not the overwhelmed public defenders and even the best must put in say a third of their time into free defenses. So all defendants get a lawyer who is obliged to give them a good amount of their time starting immediately. Make qualifying as a defense lawyer part of getting one's law license. 

Someone who has so few friends and family or personal savings to put up the small bail amounts often involved does have something wrong in their mental make up that requires mental health care even if they don't want it. 

Take away cash bail fewer return for trial or prison. But with above reforms it will be months at most not year. And Progressives can put their money where their mouth is and set up foundations to give out the bail money. Want to correct pay day loans Progressives should set up non profit check cashing organizations I think they will find the high rates are at least half it not 3/4 justified on basis of how much the poor default. 
Bans on loans to the poor result in the Mob doing it, this a case it a demand that must be met.",2023-08-28T13:39:11Z,0

Terrible administrators, lack of proper funding, terrible schedules, poor treatment of teachers, teaching useless classes, focusing on heavy testing with no learning, no prep for careers, rampant drug use, lack of care for students‚Äô mental and physical health, terrible food, etc. Those were just a few. Banning CRT is at worst, a distraction to give Florida gov a reason not to fix the schools, or at best, a completely misguided attempt to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the schools. 
It is one thing to believe that solving one problem will magically fix everything. It‚Äôs another to believe solving a nonexistent problem will somehow count as doing something. Florida gov didn‚Äôt fix anything, they just made things unnecessarily worse and confusing.

There, of course, most soldiers are armed and we generally take these weapons home with us. All adults have the right to own weapons, but we need a gun license to do so - but we are not allowed to carry them on us, only when we go to a shooting range or to the military.

I'm a Swiss citizen and a gun owner who has served in our militia. When you reach the age of 18 in Switzerland, you are required to join the Army. Approximately 50% of males choose to enlist, although there are alternative options like civil service.

Upon commencing military service, we are provided with a rifle. After completing our service and fulfilling our duties as reservists, we have the option to retain our firearms, typically between the ages of 30 and 35. To retain ownership, one must obtain an official gun ownership license, which is easily attainable as long as there are no criminal records.

Yes, we are allowed to keep ammunition at home, provided we have the necessary gun license. However, strict regulations mandate secure storage, usually in a safe or a similar secure space.

Currently, only a fraction of individuals choose to keep their firearms after their service ends, roughly around 11%. This is a departure from the past when the numbers were higher.

While Switzerland does have a significant gun culture with various events centered around firearms, it's important to note that it doesn't compare to the gun craze in the United States.

Additionally, Switzerland grants its citizens considerable freedom when it comes to firearm ownership. This includes the right to possess fully automatic weapons, red dot sights, and suppressors for civilian enthusiasts.

One crucial point to mention is that you cannot casually carry a firearm in public, let alone openly. When heading to a shooting range, it's required to transport your firearm without any ammunition loaded. Ammunition may be carried separately, but only when you're en route to a shooting range or engaged in hunting activities",2023-10-25T21:45:44Z,3

It's thinking outside the box and isn't a silver bullet, so to speak, but we could pass a law that requires gun owners, before a 1 or 2 year grace period expires, to take their firearms (or just stocks vis-a-vis rifles) down to their nearest trophy shop and get their names inscribed on their guns. In big, fancy heirloom font or tiny micro-script. This will increase the chances of lost/stolen guns getting repatriated and will make tracking guns involved in crimes faster and easier than a serial number through a vitiated ATF. And no possessor of a stolen gun is going to want to tag it, so hot guns will get even hotter. And if anyone is found with a gun not bearing their name and/or one that tracks back through the serial # to a gun reported stolen, questions will be asked. Maybe by a judge.",2023-08-30T16:47:30Z,4

It doesnt bother me personally even tho I would like to pay less taxes. But I came from a poor family and still was able to go to university because someone else paid for me. Thats why I dont mind paying for someone elses education. 
Its kinds like an unwritten contract between the people. ‚ÄûI pay for you when you are in need and you pay for me when I am in need‚Äú. I dont think its unreasonable to dislike that idea. Its selfish, but not entirely unreasonable.

Especially in my city. Probably the best friend I've ever had is my Therapist. Like when I try to develop a friendship I wanna talk about what goes on in the world and what's bugging us about it. Being a progressive in a red district makes it extrememly hard to have a civil conversation with someone in person or even online. For example I told someone here my favorite musician and they went into a whole Pizza Gate conspiracy theory about the musician. When I said that was false there was friction and anger towards me. 

I also like to talk about past and present struggles and get to know how people think. (I want to become a Therapist and genuinely find people interesting) I'll offer my basic opinions and possible advice but always tell them I'm not a licensed therapist. When and if they want to ask about my life they seem intimidated by the time I'm done talking. And I often never hear from them again. Many people are intimidated by thought provoking questions and life probing questions which is understandable. They have every right not to answer any of my questions. But I find it that oftentimes people have no problem answering my questions. But it's when they ask me about my past they start to lose interest in who I am. Much of my life has been a series of unfortunate events. Those who have stayed in my life often ask how I keep going. Sometimes those who I stopped hearing from due to what I can only assume is intimidation will message me randomly after months or even  years of not talking to me just to ask me how well my life is going. When I update them on the good the bad and the ugly they reply with, ""Man that sucks I hope things get better but at least this good thing happened to you. I just want you to know you truly are an inspiration to me man. For you to live through all that and keep going it's amazing."" Then there are people who assume my whole life is a lie and try to defame me towards my friends even though I have evidence for most of the things I've been through. I guess in a world full of lies someone being completely open about their life is the scariest thing of all even if what they tell you about their life is the truth.",2024-01-22T02:43:20Z,9

We all like each other, have similar interests, kids the same age, and enjoy hanging when we do.

Those early relationships and bonds are formed and last a long time because when you are younger you and the people around you are going through ""life's shit"" at the same time and that builds lifelong bonds vs now when you are older, you are not usually experiencing and growing in life with those friends anymore, so instead you have to settle for a long term playmate.",2024-01-29T17:17:34Z,3

This is an interesting observation because firstly the dollar exchange between Canada is about $1.25 CND = $1 US. So basically, if an American comes to Canada they get a 25% discount on all goods purchased just based on the dollar exchange. Now coupled with what Americans always claim is higher taxes in Canada, Canadian groceries should be higher that American but they are not.

- Greg Abbott (R-TX) wanted to eliminate rape before it occurs. A person is not a rapist until AFTER they've committed a(t least 1) rape, NOT before. The implication is either pre-crime arrest, or letting the rape occur so that a rapist can be arrested.
- Philip Gunn (R-MS) says a rape vic should be forced to give birth, regardless of her age; Wendi Stearman (R-OK) defended underage incest rape vics being forced to give birth.
- Jean Schmidt (R-OH) called a rape pregnancy ""an opportunity"" for ""the woman, no matter how young or old she is"" when asked about a hypothetical 13yo rape vic forced by HB 598 to give birth; a few months later, such a case would occur. On the actual, Laura Strietmann (R-OH) said that ""a pregnancy might've been difficult on a ten-year-old's body, but a woman's body is designed to carry life""; Michael Gonidakis (R-OH) said the 10yo would receive ""mental healthcare"".
- HB 2779 by Rebecca Alexander (R-TN) allows ""anyone"" to sue an abortion recipient (of any age) for that abortion, the only exception being that a rapist cannot sue their potentially-underage vic; however, ""anyone"" lets them use someone as a proxy to sue their vic for them, bypassing that restriction preventing them from directly suing their vic.
- Bryan Slaton (R-TX/2021) and Rob Harris (R-SC/2023) want abortion classified as a capital crime punishable by death; the latter's bill grants homicide protections (up to capital punishment) to a fertilized egg, *which doesn't address the age of the impregnated female.*
> Prosecution for extra-state travel for abortion has been tabled.
- Sen. Warren Hamilton (R-OK) questioned why HB 4327 would allow removal of an ectopic pregnancy.
- 2 Florida high-schoolers were denied abortions in 2022 -- one for her GPA, the other because the judges ruled her ""too immature"" *despite agreeing with her that she met all of their requirements.*
- Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito apparently overturned Roe v. Wade for adoption supply.
- Mike Johnson (R-LA) says abortion rights lead to less ""able-bodied workers"".

_""(David) Eastman is against abortion in all forms. He tried to add a right-to-life amendment to a non-controversial resolution in 2017 that designated April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and filed a complaint when the committee wouldn't consider his amendment._
_In February 2023, at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee, Eastman said ""It gets argued periodically that [fatal child abuse is] actually a cost savings because that child is not going to need any of those government services that they might otherwise be entitled to receive and need based on growing up in this type of environment."" His statements have been critiqued by fellow representatives and constituents as callous and hypocritical, as he is adamantly opposed to abortion. He was censured for his remarks by the Alaska State House in a vote of 35‚Äì1, with Eastman himself as the sole vote against the censure.""_

Also, there are plenty of prosecution and defence teams who are in relationships. It would only be a conflict of interest and harm the case, if they were on opposing sides and were jeopardising the case in that way.
We don't know the motive of the friend but it is public record and she admitted that she resigned from the DA's office in lieu of being fired in unfavourable circumstances which ended their friendship. This is something that she admitted, so it may be that she has ulterior motives or is still bitter from 2022.
It could be that she was telling the truth, definitely, but with this information, it does call her credibility into question. The fact that there is nobody else or other proof to corroborate her testimony does ring alarm bells in my head.

1-no one can buy more than one unit of housing per state, city, or at least in some circumstances per neighborhood and if any one has more than 1, they should sell immediately, this would also lower the cost since a lot of houses would be available asap
2-if you want to demolish/rebuild a realstate, you should at least add an additional unit to the original house, for example if you destroy an apartment with 8 units to rebuild, it should at least be 9 units, or if it's a large house, it should be two medium houses now,or a large house with two separate floors/units 
3-buildings that are too old, and deemed dangerous or hazardous for the neighborhood, should be demolished and rebuild by the government using tax money, and it's residents should be housed in new units,this way you can also add 10/20 more units and the money spent on rebuilding will be regained as well
4- poor people who can't afford living in those cities anyways,offer them loans and benefits, if they agree to leave large cities and go live in nearby cities. 
5- if someone has an empty house or apartment just sitting there ,maybe they left for the countryside and keeping that house as part of their heritage or as a memento of their youth in the city but it's now empty and no one lives there,you can't do that! unless you pay additional taxes for that.
6- government should build a bunch of houses, maybe a 1000 units or so, but instead of selling or renting, rent them for life! it means a family can pay maybe 1/5 or 1/10 of the actual price,and live there until the person who signed the lease dies, and then evacuate and the next family can rent that house or apartment. this way housing would be a lot more affordable,and people can't demolish,change or combine their housing units.
7-it's somewhat more radical than the rest of the list, but i think it's also more powerful, wealthy businesses such as banks, or multi-billion dollar industries, must provide their employees with a housing unit,preferably nearby/ right next to/under or over the actual building of that business. this way not only housing is fixed, there will be less traffic also",2023-11-28T15:58:45Z,2

Prescribed medications are free for children, elderly, those on low incomes and people with certain chronic illnesses.

Access should be equal and affordable for everyone everywhere.

When the doctor went outside to help the man, the IDF started shooting at him.  He had to run back inside to avoid being shot, so they called him back and told him to come outside again.

This is not how a professional military force secures a target.  This is how they terrorize a population.

They started the campaign at this hospital by destroying one of the exterior walls - also completely unnecessary if your goal is to deny a command center to the enemy.

Make no mistake.  They are targeting hospitals to make treated the wounded impossible.  Even if they are being used by Hamas, you don't destroy the building to deal with that, and you don't kill patients.  You secure the facility like a goddamn professional military force and then you CONTROL that facility so that you can apprehend Hamas who are brought there for treatment, while also providing a forward medical treatment facility for your own troops and the local civilian population.

If the IDF is being honest about their intentions, they are quite literally the most incompetent military force in the developed world.  Nobody would conduct this operation in this way if their goals were what Netanyahu claims they are.",2023-12-28T06:21:55Z,36

In 1856 a scientist studied CO2 and its concentration, and surmised that if it should rise, the Earth would warm. Climate change became ""a thing"" in 1988 when the CO2 level was 350 and humans were emiting 22 gigatons and increasing at a rate of about 0.3 to 0.4 GT per year. Since then glacier and permafrost have been melting and temperatures rising. CO2 is now 417 ppm and emissions are 36 GT and increasing still increasing.  Though a freezer door is no longer opened wider than it already is, once it is open to any extent, thawing will continue.  Similarly, we can slow down emissions or even stop them, but the door to global warming (CO2 above 300-350 ppm) has already been breached, and we can't unbreach it.¬†

I did not go a night without hearing a volley of gunfire. When we first moved to the city in 2017 I would call shots fired to 911 every time I heard them so almost nightly. The dispatcher always asked me the same thing. ""Can you see if anyone is hit?"" When I said no then I would never even see KCPD.  One night I was woken up by someone actively trying to kick in my door. I immediately contacted 911 and it took police who's station is less than a mile from me 45 mins to get there and they had no sense of urgency. I had just moved into that home and whomever was kicking the door in did not know me. Since we are forced to be very aware that we are expected to stop them ourselves the door they were attempting to kick in had a kick block that likely saved me and my two children from being in a home invasion.  We had a murder every weekend. The KCPD are reactive not proactive especially in black and brown neighborhoods. 2 weeks ago I moved into the suburbs with my children and we havent heard one shooting. Ppl get murdered here weekly and no one is ever caught. Or when they are caught especially caught with a weapon they are usually linked to several other shootings. We had a guy recently wait outside a bar with an Ar15 and sprayed the crowd as ppl left during last call. When they got that rifle and tested it they matched it to 3 other homicides. KCPD needs a complete overhaul.  As many told me in my old neighborhood.  ""Pd never comes to help us they just come to arrest us "" there is also a deep mistrust to LE for good reason.

They would have wanted to keep as much intel intact if he had any in there. They could shoot him in all sorts of ways without much issue. If they wanted to just blow him up, they didn't even need to land.
The reports are after the main raid a truck of more ISIS fighters was incoming so air support blew that up. Then they had some unspecified issue with their own helicopter so they demolished it with explosives as well, and I think they said they hit it with another set of air strike explosives just to be sure. So no issues with using explosives, just they didn't really have a need to use it on the guy's house.

It does not make sense that he would know that you're coming and hide behind his family. Maybe fear of torturing family members but often times those cells work independently so family doesn't know anything and sometimes or even surprised at the Target their family member was a terrorist or was living a violent life.

According to their accounts, they believe that the attack was deliberate and not a case of mistaken identity. Some survivors and researchers argue that there is evidence to suggest that the Israeli forces were aware of the ship‚Äôs identity as an American vessel.

These survivors claim that the attack involved prolonged aerial and naval assaults, including strafing of life rafts and the American flag, which would indicate a deliberate intention to sink the ship and eliminate all witnesses. They assert that the ship‚Äôs identification markings were visible and that the Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats had ample opportunity to distinguish the ship as an American vessel.

Additionally, some survivors argue that communication intercepts from the Israeli military and testimonies from Israeli pilots support the notion that the attack was intentional. They believe that political considerations and the desire to prevent the ship from monitoring Israeli military activities during the Six-Day War may have influenced the decision to attack.

It is worth noting that these survivor accounts and alternative interpretations of the incident exist alongside the official investigations and conclusions reached by both the United States and Israel, which maintained that the attack was a case of mistaken identity.
