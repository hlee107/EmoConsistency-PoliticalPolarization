The glorification of the, ‚Äúthug‚Äù or ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù lifestyle, in our media, music, and etc.. Which doesn‚Äôt always directly contribute to someone shooting up a place/or group of people, but is a contributing factor. At the same time you can‚Äôt blame the gun for what the person behind it does. I am Pro2A, and I am no where near saying  I have all the answers. I do believe collaboration would benefit everyone. But, I just feel like we cannot ignore the fact that our culture glorifies illegal gun use especially to our minors. A lot of the time we never want to talk about repercussions of illegal acts. Especially with our young. Yes, there are definitely people and groups that do now, and I am all for more education. But, also, where does it stop at? Today it‚Äôs guns,‚Ä¶ Is it knives tomorrow? Or, cars or baseball bats, or what? Where is the line drawn? 
Also, I felt like it left out people who own guns to hunt. Not because of food shortage, obviously, but by choice. Or, because some people just prefer to know where their food comes from and/or what is in their food. Or, just because they prefer what some would refer to as a, ‚Äúmore simple lifestyle‚Äù. All I am really saying here, is that I would have also liked to see those views expanded upon and debated upon, also. 
Everyone has their own opinion and I respect that for everyone. I definitely would like to see everyone come together and collaborate on something that could actually help our society, other than a temporary fix. But, I respectfully digress.",2023-09-01T09:13:35Z,3

The luxury items and the money is usually owned by the higher ups, family members of the cartel boss or key people within the cartel. These higher ups don't engage in narco gunfights, they only give out orders. 

The average member of the cartel is usually the one who takes the biggest risks for the lowest payout.  

Example: On Monday you joined because the cartel offered you $1k and by Thursday you are already dead because of a gunfight or you came out as one of the names in a narco interrogation. 

Not everyone in the cartel is a ""soldier"" many work handling the drugs/money, others work carrying the product, money or guns from point A to point B. Then there are the halcones in towns to keep an eye out for police and rival cartel movement. The average street dealer and the soldier or ""Sicario"". 

Depending on the region in Mexico you are in and the cartel that controls that area, a Mexican can be forced to join the cartel or can willingly join for salaries of 1-3k a month. Being a transporter of product or packaging drugs in a city like Culiac√°n is relatively safe compared to being a soldier fighting to take or defend a territory or plaza. Add the poor training, been drugged or drunk right before a gunfight and it is clear why cartels are always in need for more soldiers. Most cartel soldiers don't reach the 5 year mark, they die or go to prison. In really hot plazas or disputed territories, soldiers don't last a week after being recruited. 


The narco propaganda is probably one of the most efective and powerful in the world. It offers the illusion of a life of luxury for joining a cartel, but in reality the cartel members sign their lives away to be used as cannon fodder to make the cartel boss and the higher ups richer.",2023-06-10T20:52:42Z,97

I use to ask him like why wasn‚Äôt he scared about going back to prison. And basically he told me every time he went to prison, he had friends already there, since he was a hustler who liked to share all his ‚Äúearnings‚Äù he was well liked by everyone. He told me he would do things like get close with a female guard to smuggle in things like cigarettes and he would just give the cigs to everyone in his cell block or when he was out in the yard. So he said he always felt like Robin Hood just coming back to his people when he would go back to prison. My cousin could have honestly been some huge business tycoon but he came to the US as a teen, with an accent, and bullied everyday. So where do you turn to in those situations when you live in LA back in the 90s? You turn to the gangs who offered brotherhood and protection. My cousin is doin well tho, he got deported back to the Philippines where I hear he has turned over a new leaf and has a new family there. His two sons here are grown and doin amazing things with their lives. But yeah long story short, prison is tough and scary for a lot of people, but the flip side of that is the prison system is not doin enough to change lives for the better. My cousin should have done more to learn from his bad decisions in life, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. Regardless of that, these privatized prison industries just need to be abolished",2024-02-02T16:47:12Z,105

Subtext for instance won't get you high, buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, is actually prevents you from getting high and helps prevent overdose, hence why it is hard to get people addicted to opioids to take it. Maybe if you were completely opioid naive, you might get a small buzz. He's not only not very believable but also pretty annoying, also, why was he in prison? I usually love VICE docs.

Cos the state in India where I'm from, Kerala - witnessed something like this, but more sinister. In 1984 (before I was even born), there was a man called Sukumara Kurup who also wanted to encash on a hefty insurance policy he'd bought. He and his accomplices first kidnapped and murdered an innocent man who shared physical resemblance (height and weight) with him and engineered a road traffic accident in the dead of the night. They seated the victim in the driver's seat, deliberately crashed the car (the accused's own) and intentionally set it alight, completely charring the car and its occupant.
He disappeared but the plan didn't actually work - thankfully. The police soon came to the conclusion that the body belonged to another man whose wife had reported him as missing for 2 days. She identified him from the remnants of his burned underwear - the only thing they were able to retrieve from the crime scene. Remember this was an age when modern DNA testing methods were still in their infancy. 
Their suspicion rose further when they paid a visit to the accused's house. The relatives didn't look to be particularly distressed and they were even witnessed to be eating chicken - this NEVER happens in a grieving Indian household. 
The clinching evidence came when one of the main accused's accomplices and neighbor came to the police station for questioning. He was wearing a neatly pressed full sleeve shirt - again something of an anomaly. Upon interrogation, they found he was wearing it to conceal the burn wounds he'd sustained on his forearms whilst setting the car alight. And then, the house of lies they built quickly collapsed like a pack of cards.
P. S - The crime was solved but they never captured Mr Kurup, the criminal who faked his own death. He's been on the run ever since. They were close to catching him multiple times; so much so that once they broke into his hotel room to notice the tea in the cup was still warm - a la Pablo Escobar. 
If he's alive today, he'd be around 80 years old. A fugitive on a never ending run; a lifetime in hiding - perhaps a greater punishment than anything else?",2023-05-28T11:56:05Z,556

One is a large, fully open boat, that can fit like 5 people or three and some stuff. It's not easy to canoe by yourself. You need to know all about being in stern and steering with an oar and you need to be strong.

The other is a solo boat with a closed body and double sided oar that you can easily steer and move by yourself.

One is designed to fly across lakes and down rivers. The other is designed for the ocean and you can easily recover from a capsize with a roll.

This has been around for as long as online purchases have been a thing. When I first became aware of it in the early/mid 90s, you could get lists of cards and card generators from AOL chat rooms and warez sites. Back then, banks and websites hadn't caught up to the security aspect of it yet so there weren't things like the 3 digit code on the back, security questions, or even SSL. If you had the card number and expiration date, that's all you needed. And card companies used simple algorithms to generate numbers. So, people wrote programs to generate their own card numbers and exps and you could just try them until you found a combination that worked. It's not hacking. It's just theft. And these kids are just the next in a long line of thieves stretching back to the 80s or even 70s.",2022-11-17T19:56:37Z,888

If I interpreted this correctly:

1. Hold your breath, quick look to see if you can sprint to area with lo/no gas and go.. else sit where you are.

3. Wear long clothes.
4. Carry a quality mask with cannisters rated for CS. Have it prepped and know how to employ it before you actually need it. One is none, two is one!
5. Have no delusion that your government hates your guts.

One of the most important rules as a street medic is to always know what your doing and if your not 100% familiar with possible consequences of your treatment to not to go ahead with them.

Also no, milk is not a wonder weapon against exposure to chemicals. Even when used to flush out pepper Spray there is a higher chance to do more harm with milk, than if you just used distilled water, with basically no benefits.

If you want to help out at protest without much thought: bring food and water!
Most people will greatly underpack for the day and bring Barely any supplies for themselves!
Handing out some meals will greatly increase moral and enough water on hand will help prevent dehydration from all the physical action.

If you want to be a good Street Medic, take first aid courses, join a official aid organization (if possible) and gain some proper knowledge before going out to protests in privat claiming to know everything important because as you can see, it can be extremely easy to do more harm than good.

Yes the internet can be a great place to learn but always make sure to read up multiple articles on a certain topic and confirm that the sources are linked to information from reliable professionals.",2022-11-22T19:52:54Z,1
