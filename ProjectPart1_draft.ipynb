    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "We want to figure out whether the current political polarization is associated with the emotional values expressed by each party. Due to the current politically charged environment of our country, the semblance of sympathizing toward a value that is not related to your political party causes backlash. This fear of backlash can create a “false” polarized environment, which is an extension of the fear itself. The question that arises is whether these boundaries are reinforced by the people themselves and/or  external factors, like social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "1. Do political parties exhibit similar emotional responses to differing ideologies?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "To investigate this topic, we will analyze content from the top five YouTube channels associated with Democratic and Republican viewpoints, based on subscriber counts. The channels selected for the study are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Democratic-leaning Channels**: Vice, Vox, MSNBC, The Daily Show, The Young Turks\n",
    "- **Republican-leaning Channels**: Fox News, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, The Daily Mail, The Daily Wire\n",
    "\n",
    "We have identified eight key ideologies for this analysis to understand if there are emotional differences in how political parties discuss these topics. For each ideology, a set of keywords has been established to facilitate data scraping:\n",
    "a\n",
    "- **ISIS**: Terrorism, Extremism, Radical\n",
    "- **Guns**: Shootings, School shooting, Firearms, Gun control, NRA, Second Amendment\n",
    "- **Immigration**: Border control, Mexico, Visa /Citizenship, Asylum, Deportation, Refugee\n",
    "- **Economy**: Budget deficit, Unemployment, Inflation, Interest rate, Federal Reserve, Market, Employment\n",
    "- **Health care**: Medicaid, Covid, Obamacare, Public health, Insurance\n",
    "- **Socio-economic**: Rich / poor, Income inequality, Poverty, Wealth distribution\n",

    "- **AllSides**: A media bias tool that provides a rating based on \"multi-partisan Editorial Reviews by trained experts and Blind Bias Surveys™ in which participants rate content without knowing the source.\" We used this tool to determine how we should classify the most popular (based on subscriber count) YouTube channels we found. (Source: https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-rating-methods)\n",
    "- **HypeAuitor**: A company that uses a data-driven approach to influencer marketing. In the process, they collated lists of YouTube based on category, subscriber count, and country. This allowed us to find YouTube channels that focused on news and politics with the most subscribers. (Source: https://hypeauditor.com/about/company/, https://hypeauditor.com/top-youtube-news-politics-united-states/)\n",
    "- **Pew Research Center**: A nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that conducts research on public opinion, demographic trends, and social issues. It provides data-driven insights into various aspects of social science issues, explicitly stating they do not take a stance on political issues. For our research, we relied on their studies on political ideologies and alignment with political parties as a reference.

His piece on \"Doomsday Peppers\" sealed the deal for me. So he and his very talented film crew flew down and we spent the entire day filming and shooting. I\\'ll be putting together a video on my channel with some fun behind the scenes footage from that day.\\xa0\\n\\nWhatever guns mean to you, good, bad, or indifferent; they are here to stay, just like our freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, right to fair and speedy trial, right to due process of law, etc. The 2nd amendment protects THE PEOPLE. And I meant what I said about mental health reform. That\\'s the topic we should be discussing.

You remained neutral showing all walks of life from culture to political that maintained the middle road on this topic.  I appreciate that very much.  When I first saw the title knowing Vice's history, I was very skeptical on whether this was going to be a smear fest.  Well done video and hope those that either was on the fence with firearms or completely against them have a bit of a better viewpoint on the matter.  If one person changed their mind to become a responsible gun owner, it is a win in my book.\",\n",

But this year has been a nightmare. Even the homeless shelters are turning people away. Rehabs are closed to new patients, most places aren't hiring (especially places that employ felons), offices where you get your ID and apply for SSDI are online-only which doesn't help people who don't have a phone. This year has sucked for everyone, and a lot of people have lost their jobs and are scared of what the future will bring. But if you have a safe place to sleep every night, if you have food in your fridge, be grateful. Many people are one bad car accident away from losing their livelihood and their home. If you know where you are going to sleep tonight and if you know that you will have a meal tomorrow, you are okay. Many are not.\",\n",

Little did I know that there were countless homeless people especially in the heart of the city who will be gathering there to find shelter in the late nights when the major public has gone to sleep peacefully at home.\\nI thank God for all the non profits and social entrepreneurs that are doing all they can in supporting those in need especially during seasons of social distancing.

Two days later the thief was found dead with signs of torture and with Hot Wheels cars glued to his back. It was a message from the cartel to all the car theft gangs. The cartel did the same to the kidnapping gangs and has been doing it for a while as a way of protecting us. A lot of people praise the cartel for doing so and support  them (not me). BUT the capture and release of Ovidio (El Chapo's son) in 2019 and again last weekend were two episodes of terror that changed the entire perspective. Now people are afraid of the cartel, and many are suffering from PTSD from last weekend's rampage of shootings, burnings and theft.  People are afraid of leaving their homes because we hate to admit that the worse is yet to come.\",\n",

       "   'CommentTitle': 'Hi Vice. Hi Jeremy. I am somewhere between a follower of Ned Ludd and a follower of Jean Luc Picard. I am excited for many of these (possible) changes to the world that can extend the shelf life of humans--and I\\'m okay with a lot more of the alternatives and makeshift visions in this video than almost anyone I grew up with--but I also think that most of the folks in the Pacific Northwest of the United States who are dragging behind these alternatives and visions are worried about the disconnect between our physical selves\\' involvement with this physical world. \\n\\nI love working on cars. I love it. It\\'s one of the most white trash markers of my identity that I fully embrace, even though I\\'ve been a labor, political, and community organizer in order to eat for most of the past fifteen years. \\n\\nThese transitions, for what may or may not be a \"rare bird\" like myself, must include how we can remain physical bodies engaged with and connected to our physical world. I like that connection. I like trees--planting them, trimming them, cutting them down when need be. I like mechanical stuff and the fact that the old cars that don\\'t require the latest version of MS Office are accessible to me to Lego and tinker with. I like CDs and Albums. \\n\\nIn short: I am a sucker for the sensate world. \\n\\nI have tried to imagine how to transition Oregon\\'s economically depressed coastal towns that used to be timber towns into paying positions that are more vital and productive but still allow the dirt to get under your fingernails. I imagine someone whose  parent logged trees because s/he loved the smell and feel of the forest being able to have a job in the same place, with the same solitude in nature essential to a healthy ego that knows it ain\\'t the Alpha or Omega because it\\'s able to see its own smallness out there and have nature fill the nostrils--maybe the one who is planting a bio-diverse future of trees is simultaneously living the tradition of their ancestor while doing the needed and productive thing out there today (planting rather than reaping what nature has sewn.) \\n\\nI understand that I\\'m screaming into the nothingness, but I do hope the nothingness has ears to listen. \\n\\nThank you. This is a really thought-provoking piece.',\n",

Still, I actually paid around $800 just to reserve my spot for a trip to Nicaragua to help distribute medical supplies and help the locals with essential primary care. The e-mails with the coordinators started getting kind of suspicious for me because they next wanted $1000 for something else and another $800 for ‘paperwork.’ I ended up pulling out because the trip was becoming unaffordable to me and my family had warned me about volunteering scams in Latin America, where none of that money reached the actual people.

I don’t know if anything similar happens here as well, but let me share a story where I volunteered to a very remote area in Indonesia with a medical organization initiated by an Indonesian surgeon. It was short yet very rewarding as we managed to provide care for 900 ish persons by the course of only 4 days in a small island (Indonesia is an archipelagic country). It was obviously tiring, but at the end of the trip we didn’t even think about that. Most volunteers were doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. I didn’t pay a single penny as it wasn’t voluntourism. Bottom line, not every volunteering opportunity is a voluntourism. Please don’t be discouraged to do volunteer work, do your research and I’m sure you’re going to find an honest volunteering project. My heart breaks for the children involved in such practices like the one in the video. I hope those practices get shut down somehow.',\n",

       "   'CommentTitle': \"I'm from India and watching this gave me a feeling of deja vu. Cos the state in India where I'm from, Kerala - witnessed something like this, but more sinister. In 1984 (before I was even born), there was a man called Sukumara Kurup who also wanted to encash on a hefty insurance policy he'd bought. He and his accomplices first kidnapped and murdered an innocent man who shared physical resemblance (height and weight) with him and engineered a road traffic accident in the dead of the night. They seated the victim in the driver's seat, deliberately crashed the car (the accused's own) and intentionally set it alight, completely charring the car and its occupant.\\nHe disappeared but the plan didn't actually work - thankfully. The police soon came to the conclusion that the body belonged to another man whose wife had reported him as missing for 2 days. She identified him from the remnants of his burned underwear - the only thing they were able to retrieve from the crime scene. Remember this was an age when modern DNA testing methods were still in their infancy. \\nTheir suspicion rose further when they paid a visit to the accused's house. The relatives didn't look to be particularly distressed and they were even witnessed to be eating chicken - this NEVER happens in a grieving Indian household. \\nThe clinching evidence came when one of the main accused's accomplices and neighbor came to the police station for questioning. He was wearing a neatly pressed full sleeve shirt - again something of an anomaly. Upon interrogation, they found he was wearing it to conceal the burn wounds he'd sustained on his forearms whilst setting the car alight. And then, the house of lies they built quickly collapsed like a pack of cards.\\nP. S - The crime was solved but they never captured Mr Kurup, the criminal who faked his own death. He's been on the run ever since. They were close to catching him multiple times; so much so that once they broke into his hotel room to notice the tea in the cup was still warm - a la Pablo Escobar. \\nIf he's alive today, he'd be around 80 years old. A fugitive on a never ending run; a lifetime in hiding - perhaps a greater punishment than anything else?\",\n",

Suddenly, my house was put on lock down and I could no longer access group therapy, my therapist, meetings, and my sponsor. I tried meetings on zoom but they seldom helped. I was forced to isolate and the thought of using started to sound better and better as the weeks went on. I kept feeding the thought, it turned into a craving, and I ended up relapsing. I was kicked out and moved back home, and I started using fentanyl again. I relapsed for 6 months. I had to go to rehab for the third time. I have 51 days clean today.',\n",

They went home Sunday morning and I stayed behind because I had a friend that lived in Vegas @ the time. We had planned to go to the strip that night and check out the festival. But earlier in the day we had went to reef dispensary and bought edibles . We took them and knocked out that whole night into the day time. I woke up to so many misssed calls and people worrrying about me. I was so lost and unaware what was happening cause it felt like a normal morning to me but then when I flipped the tv on I saw it going on literally 8 miles down the road. That edible may have saved my life. Crazy thinking back on it how big of an event this was.',\n",

The amount of guns and ammunition he had amassed was just staggering.  The meticulous planning......from the scouting of the venue to the hotel/room used and the amount of setup involved to avoid detection is just a sign of a truly criminal and evil minded individual.\",\n",

Making abortions illegals doesn\\'t stop abortions: it stops SAFE abortions. What is important is finding out the causes of these abortions and why the child is not being kept rather than effectively torturing the mother and the potentially-still-being-aborted child for no other reason other than to say \"we followed our faith and beliefs!\" \\n\\n\\nNow, I have two things to ask those people:\\n1) If you are doing this for God, then why does it matter if other people think you are following your beliefs or not as long as God knows? If I want to try to stop abortions, then I am going to be a kind and open individual who is trying to convince and help people to keep the child. Sure, on paper you see that I am technically pro-choose, pro-Planned Parenthood, etc etc, but I don\\'t care about that. What I care about is that I am personally helping a potential mother by improving her life in a way that can convince her to keep the child, and to potentially convince her of my beliefs without forcing my beliefs onto her.\\n2) Knowing all of this, why are you intentionally trying to make women suffer? If we understand that making abortions illegal only stops safe abortions, and you are okay with that because \"these women deserve to suffer and die for this murder they felt this dire, life-altering need to commit,\" then you are not a damn Christian! No Christian should want to ENCOURAGE the PAIN AND SUFFERING of ANYONE. We must forgive and understand. We must learn from our pasts, our presents, and use that to try to change our futures. \\n\\n\\nAnd for those who will now try to pull the Westboro Baptist Church card on me, I have this conspiracy theory that they are actually Satanists trying to drive people away from God, because - let\\'s be real - that is exactly what they are doing.',\n",

Like the old man I saw on the street with a fresh wound that was carved with a machete on the right side of his face after he couldn't pay men who were blacking mailing him. I still remember how his eye right eye dangled down on to his right cheek as blood trickle down his neck and his depressing body posture, He was looking at the ground like that's where he belonged. People were walking right by him as if it was normal to see it, The people were like a strong flowing river moving around rock.  This is only one story of the many I've seen, The Filipino government is Evil! And it's fair to say after my experience you could compare them to Satan. This was only 2 years ago and still today poverty still thrives in the Philippines yet morals and beliefs, Created a hell for the people, Where prayers to their  non-existence Gods  are the actually only hope for this country and their people. One day I'm going to make sure poverty will be minimum in my mothers country, I will make a difference!\",\n",

After spending countless hours of conversation with detox nurses (almost always non ex addicts), who often pick my brain for a better understanding themselves, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that\\n 1. There\\'s a desperate need for ex-addicts to transition into professional positions leading the charge towards effective treatment because 2. \\'Treatment\\' is often just a business opportunity for people who take advantage of the stigma and misunderstandings of drug addiction. 3. The stigmas around addiction, responsible for the lack of progress and isolation of addicts, needs to change ( and it is, wait till it\\'s your loved one) 4. Places depicted in the film are only really necessary because ^all of the above has lead to a great need for harm reduction. My best friend, from childhood, passed last year from an infection and I wish he was never so isolated, heartbroken from the misconceptions and recklessly using when 5. *Community is pretty much the meaning of life for humans. With community an addict has the reason, the capacity and support to say \"I can do this, I owe it to myself and everyone who loves me and I believe in myself\"* \\n\\nI hope something shifts in the way we approach addiction, as a whole. This will effect you too, if it hasn\\'t somehow already and nobody\\'s immune. At the top, wealthy people find ways to profit while no progress is made and I can confidently say that it\\'s time we listen to new ideas.',\n",

When you have true passion for something you forget everything, you block out everything else. I for example am afraid of getting drowned, I have phobia to deep water. I don\\'t know how to swim and I had been paralyzed by fear even in public pools BUT I once decided I wanted to do underwater photos in a cenote. I hired a pro diver, learned the basics of diving with oxygen in a couple minutes and went deep into a very deep cenote. I focused entirely in the pictures. I even pushed myself harder and deeper to get better shots. Death wasn\\'t an issue, fear was just something useless for me to take the pictures, an annoying obstacle that I pushed aside with hatred or disdain. You don\\'t think in anything else, you only want to create awesome work. Once I got out and saw what I did the fear started to sip in, I said to myself \"wtf did I just do?! I could have died\". But the results where too shinny to be afraid for too long.\\n\\nPassion helps you go through anything. I bet that\\'s how you feel when you are in a war zone taking pictures or in any dangerous situation. It\\'s something only people with that kind of passion can understand.',\n",

       "   'CommentTitle': 'My mom had bariatric surgery in Tijuana a year ago. I told her months prior that it was a bad idea and told her not to do it. She said the place had wonderful reviews and everyone in the Facebook group was happy and it was \"better care than you\\'d get at a hospital here in the US.\" A week before she left, I saw a news article of a woman who had the exact procedure done and then returned to the US and died a few days later from complications. My mom can\\'t be reasoned with or told that she\\'s wrong, so she told me to shut up and let her do what she wanted. Well, during the surgery the doctor improperly tied off a major blood vessel. The ligature came loose and my mom bled out internally. She was only found and saved because she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway from hypovolemia. She had no blood pressure cuff or heart rate monitor on her in surgery recovery. There was nobody monitoring her in her private room, she was just laying in bed unsupervised. After they found her in the hallway, they rushed her back to surgery and sucked out almost 2 liters of blood and tied the vessel off again. They gave her 3 or 4 units of packed red cells and she was still anemic. The doctor said her internals we\\'re \"greasy and fatty which caused the ligature to fall off.\" He said she was \"fattier than a good steak\" and she should never eat carbs again. Gaslighting. 🙄 Anyway, she got back home a few days later and had to have a blood test done for alllllllll the communicable blood borne diseases because of the Mexican blood transfusions. Then when she went to the FB group to tell about her experience, they immediately deleted her post and banned her from the group. The reason she saw no bad reviews and horror stories like that is because it was heavily censored. I didn\\'t even need to say \"I told you so.\" She knew. She knew, and it killed that narcissistic personality of hers. If I was her, I\\'d have gone to my PCP and requested a referral to a GI doc and asked them for an abdominal MRI to make sure they didn\\'t screw up anything else. Incapable of tying off a simple blood vessel correctly, I wonder if they left an instrument in there or created an artificial diverticulum or something bizarre. Can\\'t tell that woman anything. She knows best, she knows everything. 🙄 Worst of all, when I said \"Yeah, you almost died\" she just responded with \"Lots of things have almost killed me in my life and I beat every one of \\'em. You can\\'t kill mummzy, I\\'m a tough broad.\" 🙄',\n",

       "   'CommentTitle': 'One very important point to add in the video: Many of the people posting Narco propaganda in TikTok don\\'t own what they are showing in the videos. \\n\\nThe luxury items and the money is usually owned by the higher ups, family members of the cartel boss or key people within the cartel. These higher ups don\\'t engage in narco gunfights, they only give out orders. \\n\\nThe average member of the cartel is usually the one who takes the biggest risks for the lowest payout.  \\n\\nExample: On Monday you joined because the cartel offered you $1k and by Thursday you are already dead because of a gunfight or you came out as one of the names in a narco interrogation. \\n\\nNot everyone in the cartel is a \"soldier\" many work handling the drugs/money, others work carrying the product, money or guns from point A to point B. Then there are the halcones in towns to keep an eye out for police and rival cartel movement. The average street dealer and the soldier or \"Sicario\". \\n\\nDepending on the region in Mexico you are in and the cartel that controls that area, a Mexican can be forced to join the cartel or can willingly join for salaries of 1-3k a month. Being a transporter of product or packaging drugs in a city like Culiacán is relatively safe compared to being a soldier fighting to take or defend a territory or plaza. Add the poor training, been drugged or drunk right before a gunfight and it is clear why cartels are always in need for more soldiers. Most cartel soldiers don\\'t reach the 5 year mark, they die or go to prison. In really hot plazas or disputed territories, soldiers don\\'t last a week after being recruited. \\n\\n\\nThe narco propaganda is probably one of the most efective and powerful in the world. It offers the illusion of a life of luxury for joining a cartel, but in reality the cartel members sign their lives away to be used as cannon fodder to make the cartel boss and the higher ups richer.',\n",

The form of mockery in describing the “New World Order” or the consistent association of “conspiracy theories” to the Qanon movement is apparent. Believing that the ultra wealthy meet in private to discuss how they will shift the world is not far-fetched anymore when you look how many things in society have changed in the last couple of years. The Qanon movement is over exaggerated and honestly over praising Trump when in reality he’s not saving any of us. This association immediately makes people look dumb and discredits ALL critical thought. \\n\\nThese subtle associations of people who question the ultra wealthy who aren’t as nice as these Miami bachelors is the very reason there’s such a huge disconnect between those in power and those collecting food stamps. Again I give credit to the lighthearted-ness of the documentary. But there’s still a level of backhanded-ness to those who actually do the research and those who just let it go because Vice labels these people as kids with trust funds “just living their best lives”. \\n\\nThe rawness that we would want on topics like secret societies and the Bohemian Grove will never truly be brought to light because Alex Jones is the crazy poster boy and the super wealthy own VICE lol.\\n\\nThis will always be “color in the lines journalism” and never the truth which I hope everyone understands.\\n\\nEducate with a grain of salt my friends.

       "   'CommentTitle': \"Unfortunately Zeke is very confused about what an expensive home costs today.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter just graduated from University a couple of years ago and bought her first home, with her fiance, for just under $1 million. This is just a medium sized (1800 ft²) 3 bedroom bungalow on the outskirts (1 hour drive to the city) of a medium sized city; nothing special.\\n\\nTo compare things, my parents bought a slightly larger home home, much closer to the city center, in 1970 for less than $35k, while earning $32k per year (single income and 2 years out of university too).\\n\\nThe reality is that today house prices have become absolutely insane. My daughter and her fiance are both engineers but their combined income is only a little over 1/10th of the price of the home they bought. It will take them a very long time to pay it off.\\n\\nMy father on the other hand, back in 1970, was able to buy 2 new cars, fully furnish their home with new furniture, travel to Europe on vacation with the entire 4 member family every 2 to 3 years, etc.\\n\\nBack in the 70's prices for everything, especially expensive things, were roughly 1/10th the percentage of your income compared to today.\\n\\nAnother example, a brand new mid sized car with AC cost $2200 on that $32,000 salary. Today for a similar class car you'd pay closer to $40,000 on a salary of under $60,000. So salaries have less than doubled or 1.8x, while car prices have gone up by 18x.\\n\\nOne really strange fact is from 1935 until 1970 taxes on higher income earners were between 90% to 98%. Today taxes are a much smaller fraction of your income, especially for the rich.\\n\\nHow is it possible that 35 years of high taxes took things from the great depression (when rich people, like CEOs earned 1000+x more than a worker) to 1970 where CEOs only earned 2 to 3x an average worker.\\n\\nToday though, with low taxes again, we are back to the rich bringing in 1000+x more again.\\n\\nWhat gives?\",\n",

       "   'CommentTitle': 'My cousin before he got deported back to the Philippines was a big hustler out here in LA and of course in and out of prison. I use to ask him like why wasn’t he scared about going back to prison. And basically he told me every time he went to prison, he had friends already there, since he was a hustler who liked to share all his “earnings” he was well liked by everyone. He told me he would do things like get close with a female guard to smuggle in things like cigarettes and he would just give the cigs to everyone in his cell block or when he was out in the yard. So he said he always felt like Robin Hood just coming back to his people when he would go back to prison. My cousin could have honestly been some huge business tycoon but he came to the US as a teen, with an accent, and bullied everyday. So where do you turn to in those situations when you live in LA back in the 90s? You turn to the gangs who offered brotherhood and protection. My cousin is doin well tho, he got deported back to the Philippines where I hear he has turned over a new leaf and has a new family there. His two sons here are grown and doin amazing things with their lives. But yeah long story short, prison is tough and scary for a lot of people, but the flip side of that is the prison system is not doin enough to change lives for the better. My cousin should have done more to learn from his bad decisions in life, there’s no doubt about that. Regardless of that, these privatized prison industries just need to be abolished',\n",

Back then, banks and websites hadn\\'t caught up to the security aspect of it yet so there weren\\'t things like the 3 digit code on the back, security questions, or even SSL. If you had the card number and expiration date, that\\'s all you needed. And card companies used simple algorithms to generate numbers. So, people wrote programs to generate their own card numbers and exps and you could just try them until you found a combination that worked. It\\'s not hacking. It\\'s just theft.

       "   'CommentTitle': \"I don't think this was complete. I work hospice in the villages and a reality that needs to be touched on is dying in the villages. End of life usually includes using up your last dollars since you've spent so much to the villages itself. Most patients go bankrupt at death and end up in an oven. Being away from family, it's usually up to us to sit with them and they're by themselves. It becomes an end of generational wealth or leaving something behind, because they sold their homestead to move here. Everything you have left gets taken for your healthcare. While you're living it up and spending money on restaurants and nonsense, you still have to pay your healthcare costs. Your house gets sold to someone else and it's like you were never there. After your death there's usually HOA fines or fees that have to be paid and that gets taken out of your home sale because you didn't upkeep your home in the hospital and interest compounded. I've seen so many of these people completely broke at their death. All of them usually end up getting cremated and there's stacks of them. It's a fun life, but the end is very lonely and sad; if you can handle that.\",\n",

I have no desire to live in a place where my main focus is recreation. I want to cove back to my community for as long as I can, not because I have to but because I want to. I have skills and talents that are a valuable asset to the community. I have time to do things younger people don’t, like helping to plant vegetables on a community farm to donate to local food banks (our group, mostly elders 65 and above), typically raise over 20,000 pounds of vegetables a year. I help raise money for a variety of causes, run a memoir writing group for seniors, and volunteer with the local historical society. For fun, I ride my bike, kayak with a Meet Up group, hike, camp, swim. I enjoy working and socializing with people of mixed ages. Seeing seniors segregated off in their own communities-voluntarily or otherwise- is sad to me. Communities need their seniors. Seniors need to stay in touch with the generations coming up behind them. A place like the Villages seems as real to me as Disneyland. People stay busy, true, but for me, such a life would have little meaning.',\n",

I have had to deal with my own aging parents, and people in the care giving field say it is sad how little involved people are with there parents in there old age these days.

       "   'CommentTitle': 'I don’t know if I’m considered being as a essential worker but I have been working since it exploded in March. I’ve been working as a pt aide, our clinic was the only one open. At first being cautious was a big deal since you work closely with patients. Going home you have to sanitize everything from your vehicle to your clothes. The most question I got asked every time is how could I use the mask for a long time. I tell them being a veteran in the navy help to use the mask long, because I used to clean and paint spaces on a carrier when I was on the ship yards. Since the epidemic started my biggest concern is with the old folks. Due to the epidemic it’s harder for them to go to their appointment, which cause them to loose their progress. I hope one day will get back to the old way, because seeing old folks get stronger puts a smile and happiness feeling.',\n",

Take responsibility for your actions and respect ones action in how they effect other people. But yet somehow it seems there has been a radical shift in holding those responsible for making these poor choices accountable.\\n\\nI am speaking from my perspective in the US, and let me say I am truly sorry for how piss poor many of our leaders are. I shoulder a great responsibility for their lack of empathy and conduct. I know it is not my fault, but it is more my fault than any other human due to the fact that on paper we use a \"democracy\" but that does not take away from the pain in knowing the truth.\\n\\nKeep up the good work, I do feel the best course of action is to educate everyone until we can all agree. If not maybe we need to flat out hog tie some representatives and pull them into a public space and set some examples for what we expect them to do. I do not advocate violence, but something needs to be done.',\n",

For a few years after 2010 I was literally paralyzed with fear about global warming/climate change and the idea that I am only one person. I would make a bunch of FB posts and Tumblr posts telling people ways to reduce carbon footprint and stuff but mostly nobody cared. When I accepted the fact that my own death is inevitable it diminished the anxiety about entropic heat death. This kid has a confidence and natural leadership that I definitely admire. I always think its a great idea to be an activist but very rarely have I actually done anything. He is speaking up for the people who feel they don't have a voice but the more people talking about these issues the better.\",\n",

Firearms ownership is a perpetual exercise in personal responsibility. Every day, it’s in the back of your mind “hey, I have a gun,” and every day, you remind yourself that it is *your* charge. It isn’t for everybody, and that’s okay - what matters is that *you* know whether or not it’s something that you want.',\n",

His piece on \"Doomsday Peppers\" sealed the deal for me. So he and his very talented film crew flew down and we spent the entire day filming and shooting. I\\'ll be putting together a video on my channel with some fun behind the scenes footage from that day.\\xa0\\n\\nWhatever guns mean to you, good, bad, or indifferent; they are here to stay, just like our freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, right to fair and speedy trial, right to due process of law, etc. The 2nd amendment protects THE PEOPLE. And I meant what I said about mental health reform. That\\'s the topic we should be discussing.

       "  'CommentTitle': \"I live in the US and work in emergency psychiatric care primarily with homeless people. It's always hard to find treatment, housing, food, work for them. But this year has been a nightmare. Even the homeless shelters are turning people away. Rehabs are closed to new patients, most places aren't hiring (especially places that employ felons), offices where you get your ID and apply for SSDI are online-only which doesn't help people who don't have a phone. This year has sucked for everyone, and a lot of people have lost their jobs and are scared of what the future will bring. But if you have a safe place to sleep every night, if you have food in your fridge, be grateful. Many people are one bad car accident away from losing their livelihood and their home. If you know where you are going to sleep tonight and if you know that you will have a meal tomorrow, you are okay. Many are not.\",\n",

I grew up in the woods...I spent most of my time homeless in the same place...was near the river, was able to bath in it...had this little Coleman solar panel to charge my phone...my bike, tent...it wasn't all bad, at first.  But it got worse...much worse...I dropped so much weight I was at an all time low of 106 pounds.  But starting when the old farmer took me in...I've since got some medical help, and approved for disability...gained all my weight back...life is getting better, slowly but surely.  I am hoping soon I might be well enough to be able to work again.  I want to be able to give back...like all the people who helped me.\",\n",

As a Malaysian, and in my early naiveness, I had the impression that the city (ex. Kuala Lumpur) would be the place where dreams were made, an environment where zero poverty and homelessness exist. Little did I know that there were countless homeless people especially in the heart of the city who will be gathering there to find shelter in the late nights when the major public has gone to sleep peacefully at home.\\nI thank God for all the non profits and social entrepreneurs that are doing all they can in supporting those in need especially during seasons of social distancing. I hope all of us including myself will continue to do what we can to also help out with our talents, skills, times, etc in different shapes and forms. Stay M.A.D. (making a difference) and God Bless. all the way.',\n",

I couldn’t go to Mexico anymore, and it broke my heart. After watching this video, it’s heartbreaking to see that this is what Mexico is.

We would stay late until 11pm at night, would chill outside the house, but ever since the cartels took over I haven’t been in Mexico ever since. I really hope the Mexican government take this serious and put an end to cartels.',\n",

Two days later the thief was found dead with signs of torture and with Hot Wheels cars glued to his back. It was a message from the cartel to all the car theft gangs. The cartel did the same to the kidnapping gangs and has been doing it for a while as a way of protecting us. A lot of people praise the cartel for doing so and support  them (not me). BUT the capture and release of Ovidio (El Chapo's son) in 2019 and again last weekend were two episodes of terror that changed the entire perspective. Now people are afraid of the cartel, and many are suffering from PTSD from last weekend's rampage of shootings, burnings and theft.  People are afraid of leaving their homes because we hate to admit that the worse is yet to come.\",\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'Hi Vice. Hi Jeremy. I am somewhere between a follower of Ned Ludd and a follower of Jean Luc Picard. I am excited for many of these (possible) changes to the world that can extend the shelf life of humans--and I\\'m okay with a lot more of the alternatives and makeshift visions in this video than almost anyone I grew up with--but I also think that most of the folks in the Pacific Northwest of the United States who are dragging behind these alternatives and visions are worried about the disconnect between our physical selves\\' involvement with this physical world. \\n\\nI love working on cars. I love it. It\\'s one of the most white trash markers of my identity that I fully embrace, even though I\\'ve been a labor, political, and community organizer in order to eat for most of the past fifteen years. \\n\\nThese transitions, for what may or may not be a \"rare bird\" like myself, must include how we can remain physical bodies engaged with and connected to our physical world. I like that connection. I like trees--planting them, trimming them, cutting them down when need be. I like mechanical stuff and the fact that the old cars that don\\'t require the latest version of MS Office are accessible to me to Lego and tinker with. I like CDs and Albums. \\n\\nIn short: I am a sucker for the sensate world. \\n\\nI have tried to imagine how to transition Oregon\\'s economically depressed coastal towns that used to be timber towns into paying positions that are more vital and productive but still allow the dirt to get under your fingernails. I imagine someone whose  parent logged trees because s/he loved the smell and feel of the forest being able to have a job in the same place, with the same solitude in nature essential to a healthy ego that knows it ain\\'t the Alpha or Omega because it\\'s able to see its own smallness out there and have nature fill the nostrils--maybe the one who is planting a bio-diverse future of trees is simultaneously living the tradition of their ancestor while doing the needed and productive thing out there today (planting rather than reaping what nature has sewn.) \\n\\nI understand that I\\'m screaming into the nothingness, but I do hope the nothingness has ears to listen. \\n\\nThank you. This is a really thought-provoking piece.',\n",

I justified it at the time because I was addicted and regularly using. I am now clean six years and have everything in order in my life. I am now unable to have children probably due to complications from previous abortions. When I was using on the streets I did a lot of horrible things that haunt me and it's really hard to forgive myself and move on, but the thing that haunts me the most is having abortions. I do believe I will have to answer to God one day for those horrible choices and will rightfully so face the consequences.\",\n",

Most of my interactions with them were positive, learned different things from each person. It was refreshing to learn from someone else besides my regular teachers. My school’s leadership was very caring of the kids. Therefore, just do your research before you volunteer somewhere as not all schools/orphanages are run by legit good people. Don’t let bad apples dissuade you from doing good for the less fortunate. So many people need help in the world. ❤',\n",

Pre-Med students were often interested in them as a way to boost their Med school applications,\\nmyself included. The fees they charged for the trip were so exaggerated to me. Still, I actually paid around $800 just to reserve my spot for a trip to Nicaragua to help distribute medical supplies and help the locals with essential primary care. The e-mails with the coordinators started getting kind of suspicious for me because they next wanted $1000 for something else and another $800 for ‘paperwork.’ I ended up pulling out because the trip was becoming unaffordable to me and my family had warned me about volunteering scams in Latin America, where none of that money reached the actual people. I volunteered, instead, at my local hospital for 2 years and had a rewarding experience.',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'as a Nigerian teen, I get pissed off when I hear people talking about \"volunteering in Africa\" this is just one of them, coupled with the generalization of the continent and its inhabitants. they\\'re basically just selling privileged kids a sense of heroism and a chance to look good on their college application. I just finished high school and I\\'m working on a bunch of things if it all goes well I have a charity plan that can actually change people\\'s lives, it\\'s a long-term thing. I don\\'t do impulse charity it is a f up the world and people have been suffering, feeding a bunch of people might feel rewarding instantly but where is the next meal coming from? teaching people to fish and creating a conducive environment for them to do so is the ONLY way to bring change',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'I am a doctor (general practitioner) from Indonesia, and I am so very sad to hear that such thing seems to happen a lot in different parts of the world. I don’t know if anything similar happens here as well, but let me share a story where I volunteered to a very remote area in Indonesia with a medical organization initiated by an Indonesian surgeon. It was short yet very rewarding as we managed to provide care for 900 ish persons by the course of only 4 days in a small island (Indonesia is an archipelagic country). It was obviously tiring, but at the end of the trip we didn’t even think about that. Most volunteers were doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. I didn’t pay a single penny as it wasn’t voluntourism. Bottom line, not every volunteering opportunity is a voluntourism. Please don’t be discouraged to do volunteer work, do your research and I’m sure you’re going to find an honest volunteering project. My heart breaks for the children involved in such practices like the one in the video. I hope those practices get shut down somehow.',\n",

No adult will ever stay or care about them beyond those few days. The kids will stay there until they age out and instead of being given proper schooling and helpful education on how to thrive as an adult, they spent their whole childhoods being ornaments for people who are already rich.

       "  'CommentTitle': \"I'm from India and watching this gave me a feeling of deja vu. Cos the state in India where I'm from, Kerala - witnessed something like this, but more sinister. In 1984 (before I was even born), there was a man called Sukumara Kurup who also wanted to encash on a hefty insurance policy he'd bought. He and his accomplices first kidnapped and murdered an innocent man who shared physical resemblance (height and weight) with him and engineered a road traffic accident in the dead of the night. They seated the victim in the driver's seat, deliberately crashed the car (the accused's own) and intentionally set it alight, completely charring the car and its occupant.\\nHe disappeared but the plan didn't actually work - thankfully. The police soon came to the conclusion that the body belonged to another man whose wife had reported him as missing for 2 days. She identified him from the remnants of his burned underwear - the only thing they were able to retrieve from the crime scene. Remember this was an age when modern DNA testing methods were still in their infancy. \\nTheir suspicion rose further when they paid a visit to the accused's house. The relatives didn't look to be particularly distressed and they were even witnessed to be eating chicken - this NEVER happens in a grieving Indian household. \\nThe clinching evidence came when one of the main accused's accomplices and neighbor came to the police station for questioning. He was wearing a neatly pressed full sleeve shirt - again something of an anomaly. Upon interrogation, they found he was wearing it to conceal the burn wounds he'd sustained on his forearms whilst setting the car alight. And then, the house of lies they built quickly collapsed like a pack of cards.\\nP. S - The crime was solved but they never captured Mr Kurup, the criminal who faked his own death. He's been on the run ever since. They were close to catching him multiple times; so much so that once they broke into his hotel room to notice the tea in the cup was still warm - a la Pablo Escobar. \\nIf he's alive today, he'd be around 80 years old. A fugitive on a never ending run; a lifetime in hiding - perhaps a greater punishment than anything else?\",\n",

Suddenly, my house was put on lock down and I could no longer access group therapy, my therapist, meetings, and my sponsor. I tried meetings on zoom but they seldom helped.

I was kicked out and moved back home, and I started using fentanyl again. I relapsed for 6 months. I had to go to rehab for the third time. I have 51 days clean today.',\n",

They went home Sunday morning and I stayed behind because I had a friend that lived in Vegas @ the time. We had planned to go to the strip that night and check out the festival. But earlier in the day we had went to reef dispensary and bought edibles . We took them and knocked out that whole night into the day time. I woke up to so many misssed calls and people worrrying about me. I was so lost and unaware what was happening cause it felt like a normal morning to me but then when I flipped the tv on I saw it going on literally 8 miles down the road. That edible may have saved my life. Crazy thinking back on it how big of an event this was.',\n",

The amount of guns and ammunition he had amassed was just staggering.  The meticulous planning......from the scouting of the venue to the hotel/room used and the amount of setup involved to avoid detection is just a sign of a truly criminal and evil minded individual.\",\n",

America seems to me to be a nation of two-year old children screaming \"MIIIIIIIIIIINE!\" and that is what is going to be our undoing. It is no longer a common project that we have to work on together, but just a bunch of people trying to use it as a framework for doing whatever they want to do, without care for other citizens. You cannot possibly be a patriot if you are not willing to do your best to try to protect fellow citizens from the pandemic, I say as my cousin is in a hospital bed suffering from it right now.',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'A lot of people give me a confused look when I tell them that I am a Christian Orthodox who is also a moderate Democrat... and cases like these are exactly why. Making abortions illegals doesn\\'t stop abortions: it stops SAFE abortions. What is important is finding out the causes of these abortions and why the child is not being kept rather than effectively torturing the mother and the potentially-still-being-aborted child for no other reason other than to say \"we followed our faith and beliefs!\" \\n\\n\\nNow, I have two things to ask those people:\\n1) If you are doing this for God, then why does it matter if other people think you are following your beliefs or not as long as God knows? If I want to try to stop abortions, then I am going to be a kind and open individual who is trying to convince and help people to keep the child. Sure, on paper you see that I am technically pro-choose, pro-Planned Parenthood, etc etc, but I don\\'t care about that. What I care about is that I am personally helping a potential mother by improving her life in a way that can convince her to keep the child, and to potentially convince her of my beliefs without forcing my beliefs onto her.\\n2) Knowing all of this, why are you intentionally trying to make women suffer? If we understand that making abortions illegal only stops safe abortions, and you are okay with that because \"these women deserve to suffer and die for this murder they felt this dire, life-altering need to commit,\" then you are not a damn Christian! No Christian should want to ENCOURAGE the PAIN AND SUFFERING of ANYONE. We must forgive and understand. We must learn from our pasts, our presents, and use that to try to change our futures. \\n\\n\\nAnd for those who will now try to pull the Westboro Baptist Church card on me, I have this conspiracy theory that they are actually Satanists trying to drive people away from God, because - let\\'s be real - that is exactly what they are doing.',\n",

Like the old man I saw on the street with a fresh wound that was carved with a machete on the right side of his face after he couldn't pay men who were blacking mailing him. I still remember how his eye right eye dangled down on to his right cheek as blood trickle down his neck and his depressing body posture, He was looking at the ground like that's where he belonged. People were walking right by him as if it was normal to see it, The people were like a strong flowing river moving around rock.  This is only one story of the many I've seen, The Filipino government is Evil! And it's fair to say after my experience you could compare them to Satan. This was only 2 years ago and still today poverty still thrives in the Philippines yet morals and beliefs, Created a hell for the people, Where prayers to their  non-existence Gods  are the actually only hope for this country and their people. One day I'm going to make sure poverty will be minimum in my mothers country, I will make a difference!\",\n",

After spending countless hours of conversation with detox nurses (almost always non ex addicts), who often pick my brain for a better understanding themselves, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that\\n 1. There\\'s a desperate need for ex-addicts to transition into professional positions leading the charge towards effective treatment because 2. \\'Treatment\\' is often just a business opportunity for people who take advantage of the stigma and misunderstandings of drug addiction. 3. The stigmas around addiction, responsible for the lack of progress and isolation of addicts, needs to change ( and it is, wait till it\\'s your loved one) 4. Places depicted in the film are only really necessary because ^all of the above has lead to a great need for harm reduction. My best friend, from childhood, passed last year from an infection and I wish he was never so isolated, heartbroken from the misconceptions and recklessly using when 5. *Community is pretty much the meaning of life for humans. With community an addict has the reason, the capacity and support to say \"I can do this, I owe it to myself and everyone who loves me and I believe in myself\"* \\n\\nI hope something shifts in the way we approach addiction, as a whole. This will effect you too, if it hasn\\'t somehow already and nobody\\'s immune. At the top, wealthy people find ways to profit while no progress is made and I can confidently say that it\\'s time we listen to new ideas.',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'To add to his explanation as to why he wasn\\'t afraid of getting infected and explaining why he answered that he wanted to do the project. When you have true passion for something you forget everything, you block out everything else. I for example am afraid of getting drowned, I have phobia to deep water. I don\\'t know how to swim and I had been paralyzed by fear even in public pools BUT I once decided I wanted to do underwater photos in a cenote. I hired a pro diver, learned the basics of diving with oxygen in a couple minutes and went deep into a very deep cenote. I focused entirely in the pictures. I even pushed myself harder and deeper to get better shots. Death wasn\\'t an issue, fear was just something useless for me to take the pictures, an annoying obstacle that I pushed aside with hatred or disdain. You don\\'t think in anything else, you only want to create awesome work. Once I got out and saw what I did the fear started to sip in, I said to myself \"wtf did I just do?! I could have died\". But the results where too shinny to be afraid for too long.\\n\\nPassion helps you go through anything. I bet that\\'s how you feel when you are in a war zone taking pictures or in any dangerous situation. It\\'s something only people with that kind of passion can understand.',\n",

However when she was diagnosed with COPD and had her first major attack of not being able to breathe I saw fear like never before in her eyes. I saw her cry for the first time. She was completely panicked by not being able to catch her breath.  She said it felt as though she was under water and given a straw, that's a nightmare!\\nShe truly changed as a person after that. She actually told me she loved me for the first time and many times over. I really wish my mom was alive because that's all she ever wanted was her mother's love, I think it helped put her in an early grave. \\nI am glad we got those last years together.

       "  'CommentTitle': 'My mom had bariatric surgery in Tijuana a year ago. I told her months prior that it was a bad idea and told her not to do it. She said the place had wonderful reviews and everyone in the Facebook group was happy and it was \"better care than you\\'d get at a hospital here in the US.\" A week before she left, I saw a news article of a woman who had the exact procedure done and then returned to the US and died a few days later from complications. My mom can\\'t be reasoned with or told that she\\'s wrong, so she told me to shut up and let her do what she wanted. Well, during the surgery the doctor improperly tied off a major blood vessel. The ligature came loose and my mom bled out internally. She was only found and saved because she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway from hypovolemia. She had no blood pressure cuff or heart rate monitor on her in surgery recovery. There was nobody monitoring her in her private room, she was just laying in bed unsupervised. After they found her in the hallway, they rushed her back to surgery and sucked out almost 2 liters of blood and tied the vessel off again. They gave her 3 or 4 units of packed red cells and she was still anemic. The doctor said her internals we\\'re \"greasy and fatty which caused the ligature to fall off.\" He said she was \"fattier than a good steak\" and she should never eat carbs again. Gaslighting. 🙄 Anyway, she got back home a few days later and had to have a blood test done for alllllllll the communicable blood borne diseases because of the Mexican blood transfusions. Then when she went to the FB group to tell about her experience, they immediately deleted her post and banned her from the group. The reason she saw no bad reviews and horror stories like that is because it was heavily censored. I didn\\'t even need to say \"I told you so.\" She knew. She knew, and it killed that narcissistic personality of hers. If I was her, I\\'d have gone to my PCP and requested a referral to a GI doc and asked them for an abdominal MRI to make sure they didn\\'t screw up anything else. Incapable of tying off a simple blood vessel correctly, I wonder if they left an instrument in there or created an artificial diverticulum or something bizarre. Can\\'t tell that woman anything. She knows best, she knows everything. 🙄 Worst of all, when I said \"Yeah, you almost died\" she just responded with \"Lots of things have almost killed me in my life and I beat every one of \\'em. You can\\'t kill mummzy, I\\'m a tough broad.\" 🙄',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': 'One very important point to add in the video: Many of the people posting Narco propaganda in TikTok don\\'t own what they are showing in the videos. \\n\\nThe luxury items and the money is usually owned by the higher ups, family members of the cartel boss or key people within the cartel. These higher ups don\\'t engage in narco gunfights, they only give out orders. \\n\\nThe average member of the cartel is usually the one who takes the biggest risks for the lowest payout.  \\n\\nExample: On Monday you joined because the cartel offered you $1k and by Thursday you are already dead because of a gunfight or you came out as one of the names in a narco interrogation. \\n\\nNot everyone in the cartel is a \"soldier\" many work handling the drugs/money, others work carrying the product, money or guns from point A to point B. Then there are the halcones in towns to keep an eye out for police and rival cartel movement. The average street dealer and the soldier or \"Sicario\". \\n\\nDepending on the region in Mexico you are in and the cartel that controls that area, a Mexican can be forced to join the cartel or can willingly join for salaries of 1-3k a month. Being a transporter of product or packaging drugs in a city like Culiacán is relatively safe compared to being a soldier fighting to take or defend a territory or plaza. Add the poor training, been drugged or drunk right before a gunfight and it is clear why cartels are always in need for more soldiers. Most cartel soldiers don\\'t reach the 5 year mark, they die or go to prison. In really hot plazas or disputed territories, soldiers don\\'t last a week after being recruited. \\n\\n\\nThe narco propaganda is probably one of the most efective and powerful in the world. It offers the illusion of a life of luxury for joining a cartel, but in reality the cartel members sign their lives away to be used as cannon fodder to make the cartel boss and the higher ups richer.',\n",

Also, who could forget his iconic board graphics an even wanting some of his Circa shoes as a teen then actually owning and thoroughly enjoying a couple pairs of Supra Skytops. What a legend.\",\n",

Once you do that, you realize that your parent was just a person. Not perfect, but special for you.

If someone with enough money and power wants to do something they will simply change the law or move to a place where it is legal.

       "  'CommentTitle': 'It was a fun lighthearted documentary I’ll admit. I love that they made such a touchy subject so “fun”. However this felt very “Vice”. The form of mockery in describing the “New World Order” or the consistent association of “conspiracy theories” to the Qanon movement is apparent. Believing that the ultra wealthy meet in private to discuss how they will shift the world is not far-fetched anymore when you look how many things in society have changed in the last couple of years. The Qanon movement is over exaggerated and honestly over praising Trump when in reality he’s not saving any of us. This association immediately makes people look dumb and discredits ALL critical thought. \\n\\nThese subtle associations of people who question the ultra wealthy who aren’t as nice as these Miami bachelors is the very reason there’s such a huge disconnect between those in power and those collecting food stamps. Again I give credit to the lighthearted-ness of the documentary. But there’s still a level of backhanded-ness to those who actually do the research and those who just let it go because Vice labels these people as kids with trust funds “just living their best lives”. \\n\\nThe rawness that we would want on topics like secret societies and the Bohemian Grove will never truly be brought to light because Alex Jones is the crazy poster boy and the super wealthy own VICE lol.\\n\\nThis will always be “color in the lines journalism” and never the truth which I hope everyone understands.\\n\\nEducate with a grain of salt my friends. Cheers.',\n",

       "  'CommentTitle': \"Unfortunately Zeke is very confused about what an expensive home costs today.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter just graduated from University a couple of years ago and bought her first home, with her fiance, for just under $1 million. This is just a medium sized (1800 ft²) 3 bedroom bungalow on the outskirts (1 hour drive to the city) of a medium sized city; nothing special.\\n\\nTo compare things, my parents bought a slightly larger home home, much closer to the city center, in 1970 for less than $35k, while earning $32k per year (single income and 2 years out of university too).\\n\\nThe reality is that today house prices have become absolutely insane. My daughter and her fiance are both engineers but their combined income is only a little over 1/10th of the price of the home they bought. It will take them a very long time to pay it off.\\n\\nMy father on the other hand, back in 1970, was able to buy 2 new cars, fully furnish their home with new furniture, travel to Europe on vacation with the entire 4 member family every 2 to 3 years, etc.\\n\\nBack in the 70's prices for everything, especially expensive things, were roughly 1/10th the percentage of your income compared to today.\\n\\nAnother example, a brand new mid sized car with AC cost $2200 on that $32,000 salary. Today for a similar class car you'd pay closer to $40,000 on a salary of under $60,000. So salaries have less than doubled or 1.8x, while car prices have gone up by 18x.\\n\\nOne really strange fact is from 1935 until 1970 taxes on higher income earners were between 90% to 98%. Today taxes are a much smaller fraction of your income, especially for the rich.\\n\\nHow is it possible that 35 years of high taxes took things from the great depression (when rich people, like CEOs earned 1000+x more than a worker) to 1970 where CEOs only earned 2 to 3x an average worker.\\n\\nToday though, with low taxes again, we are back to the rich bringing in 1000+x more again.\\n\\nWhat gives?\",\n",

This series has impacted me so much and given me so much new insight and knowledge about the brutalities and hardship of my fellow human brothers and sisters in the Middle East. It brought me to tears listening to the injustices the refugees have suffered through in foreign countries including here in the US as well. They left the closest thing there is to hell on earth to survive, and protect their families, and live their lives in safety and peace and yet still get treated like shit in the new countries they go to. They don't deserve any of it, no human being deserves that treatment. Thank you Firat for all you have done. I will do all that I can on my end to spread awareness of this.\",\n",

Could you imagine your town, your home, turning into the frontlines of air strikes, mortar bombings and all out urban warfare? No, I don’t think you could.
